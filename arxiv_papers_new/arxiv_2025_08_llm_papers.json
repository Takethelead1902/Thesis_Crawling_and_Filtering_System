      "abstract": "We introduce a modular prompting framework that supports safer and more\nadaptive use of large language models (LLMs) across dynamic, user-centered\ntasks. Grounded in human learning theory, particularly the Zone of Proximal\nDevelopment (ZPD), our method combines a natural language boundary prompt with\na control schema encoded with fuzzy scaffolding logic and adaptation rules.\nThis architecture enables LLMs to modulate behavior in response to user state\nwithout requiring fine-tuning or external orchestration. In a simulated\nintelligent tutoring setting, the framework improves scaffolding quality,\nadaptivity, and instructional alignment across multiple models, outperforming\nstandard prompting baselines. Evaluation is conducted using rubric-based LLM\ngraders at scale. While initially developed for education, the framework has\nshown promise in other interaction-heavy domains, such as procedural content\ngeneration for games. Designed for safe deployment, it provides a reusable\nmethodology for structuring interpretable, goal-aligned LLM behavior in\nuncertain or evolving contexts.",

      "abstract": "The advent of ultra-low-bit LLM models (1/1.58/2-bit), which match the\nperplexity and end-task performance of their full-precision counterparts using\nthe same model size, is ushering in a new era of LLM inference for\nresource-constrained environments such as edge devices and AI PCs. While these\nquantization advances promise models that are more cost-effective in terms of\nlatency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption, the computational\nefficiency of state-of-the-art (SOTA) inference runtimes (e.g., bitnet.cpp)\nused to deploy them remains underexplored. In this work, we take a bottom-up\napproach: we first design and implement 1-bit and 2-bit microkernels optimized\nfor modern CPUs, achieving peak computational efficiency across a variety of\nCPU platforms. We integrate these microkernels into a state-of-the-art LLM\ninference framework, namely PyTorch-TPP, and present end-to-end inference\nresults with 2-bit models that outperform the current SOTA runtime bitnet.cpp\nby up to 2.2x, and deliver up to 7x speedup compared to the 16-bit model\ninference. Our optimized runtime advances the state of LLM inference on AI PCs\nand edge devices, paving the way for efficient deployment of ultra-low-bit LLM\nmodels.",

      "abstract": "Graph-based malware classifiers can achieve over 94% accuracy on standard\nAndroid datasets, yet we find they suffer accuracy drops of up to 45% when\nevaluated on previously unseen malware variants from the same family - a\nscenario where strong generalization would typically be expected. This\nhighlights a key limitation in existing approaches: both the model\narchitectures and their structure-only representations often fail to capture\ndeeper semantic patterns. In this work, we propose a robust semantic enrichment\nframework that enhances function call graphs with contextual features,\nincluding function-level metadata and, when available, code embeddings derived\nfrom large language models. The framework is designed to operate under\nreal-world constraints where feature availability is inconsistent, and supports\nflexible integration of semantic signals. To evaluate generalization under\nrealistic domain and temporal shifts, we introduce two new benchmarks:\nMalNet-Tiny-Common and MalNet-Tiny-Distinct, constructed using malware family\npartitioning to simulate cross-family generalization and evolving threat\nbehavior. Experiments across multiple graph neural network backbones show that\nour method improves classification performance by up to 8% under distribution\nshift and consistently enhances robustness when integrated with\nadaptation-based methods. These results offer a practical path toward building\nresilient malware detection systems in evolving threat environments.",

      "abstract": "Ensemble datasets are ever more prevalent in various scientific domains. In\nclimate science, ensemble datasets are used to capture variability in\nprojections under plausible future conditions including greenhouse and aerosol\nemissions. Each ensemble model run produces projections that are fundamentally\nsimilar yet meaningfully distinct. Understanding this variability among\nensemble model runs and analyzing its magnitude and patterns is a vital task\nfor climate scientists. In this paper, we present ClimateSOM, a visual analysis\nworkflow that leverages a self-organizing map (SOM) and Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to support interactive exploration and interpretation of climate\nensemble datasets. The workflow abstracts climate ensemble model runs -\nspatiotemporal time series - into a distribution over a 2D space that captures\nthe variability among the ensemble model runs using a SOM. LLMs are integrated\nto assist in sensemaking of this SOM-defined 2D space, the basis for the visual\nanalysis tasks. In all, ClimateSOM enables users to explore the variability\namong ensemble model runs, identify patterns, compare and cluster the ensemble\nmodel runs. To demonstrate the utility of ClimateSOM, we apply the workflow to\nan ensemble dataset of precipitation projections over California and the\nNorthwestern United States. Furthermore, we conduct a short evaluation of our\nLLM integration, and conduct an expert review of the visual workflow and the\ninsights from the case studies with six domain experts to evaluate our approach\nand its utility.",

      "title": "Large Language Models for Oral History Understanding with Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis",
      "abstract": "Oral histories are vital records of lived experience, particularly within\ncommunities affected by systemic injustice and historical erasure. Effective\nand efficient analysis of their oral history archives can promote access and\nunderstanding of the oral histories. However, Large-scale analysis of these\narchives remains limited due to their unstructured format, emotional\ncomplexity, and high annotation costs. This paper presents a scalable framework\nto automate semantic and sentiment annotation for Japanese American\nIncarceration Oral History. Using LLMs, we construct a high-quality dataset,\nevaluate multiple models, and test prompt engineering strategies in\nhistorically sensitive contexts. Our multiphase approach combines expert\nannotation, prompt design, and LLM evaluation with ChatGPT, Llama, and Qwen. We\nlabeled 558 sentences from 15 narrators for sentiment and semantic\nclassification, then evaluated zero-shot, few-shot, and RAG strategies. For\nsemantic classification, ChatGPT achieved the highest F1 score (88.71%),\nfollowed by Llama (84.99%) and Qwen (83.72%). For sentiment analysis, Llama\nslightly outperformed Qwen (82.66%) and ChatGPT (82.29%), with all models\nshowing comparable results. The best prompt configurations were used to\nannotate 92,191 sentences from 1,002 interviews in the JAIOH collection. Our\nfindings show that LLMs can effectively perform semantic and sentiment\nannotation across large oral history collections when guided by well-designed\nprompts. This study provides a reusable annotation pipeline and practical\nguidance for applying LLMs in culturally sensitive archival analysis. By\nbridging archival ethics with scalable NLP techniques, this work lays the\ngroundwork for responsible use of artificial intelligence in digital humanities\nand preservation of collective memory.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can serve as judges that offer rapid and\nreliable assessments of other LLM outputs. However, models may systematically\nassign overly favorable ratings to their own outputs, a phenomenon known as\nself-bias, which can distort evaluations of true model performance. Previous\nstudies often conflate genuine differences in model quality with bias or\nincorrectly assume that evaluations from LLMs and humans follow the same rating\ndistributions. In this work, we present a statistical framework that explicitly\nformalizes assumptions under which self-bias can be identified and estimated.\nOur method models the difference in the scoring distribution that\nLLM-as-a-judge assigns to its own completions compared to other models, while\naccounting for the underlying quality of the completions provided by an\nindependent, third-party judge (e.g., humans). Our method reliably isolates and\nquantifies self-bias, even when models vary in ability, ensuring that genuine\nperformance differences are not mistaken for self-bias. We conduct an empirical\nanalysis of self-bias on a large dataset (>5000 prompt-completion pairs)\nconsisting of expert human annotations and judgments from nine different LLM\njudges. We find that some models, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet,\nsystematically assign higher scores to their own outputs. These models also\ndisplay family-bias; systematically assigning higher ratings to outputs\nproduced by other models of the same family. Our findings highlight potential\npitfalls of using LLM judges and offer practical guidance to mitigate biases\nwhen interpreting automated evaluations.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for\nknowledge-intensive tasks across domains. In materials science, to find novel\nmaterials for various energy efficient devices for various real-world\napplications, requires several time and cost expensive simulations and\nexperiments. In order to tune down the uncharted material search space,\nminimizing the experimental cost, LLMs can play a bigger role to first provide\nan accelerated search of promising known material candidates. Furthermore, the\nintegration of LLMs with domain-specific information via retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) is poised to revolutionize how researchers predict materials\nstructures, analyze defects, discover novel compounds, and extract knowledge\nfrom literature and databases. In motivation to the potentials of LLMs and RAG\nin accelerating material discovery, this paper presents a broad and systematic\nreview to examine the recent advancements in applying LLMs and RAG to key\nmaterials science problems. We survey state-of-the-art developments in crystal\nstructure prediction, defect analysis, materials discovery, literature mining,\ndatabase integration, and multi-modal retrieval, highlighting how combining\nLLMs with external knowledge sources enables new capabilities. We discuss the\nperformance, limitations, and implications of these approaches, and outline\nfuture directions for leveraging LLMs to accelerate materials research and\ndiscovery for advancement in technologies in the area of electronics, optics,\nbiomedical, and energy storage.",

This paper studies the effect of chain-of-thought prompting, a\nrecent approach that studies the steps followed by the model before it\nresponds, on fairness. More specifically, we ask the following question:\n\\textit{Do biased models have biased thoughts}? To answer our question, we\nconduct experiments on $5$ popular large language models using fairness metrics\nto quantify $11$ different biases in the model's thoughts and output. Our\nresults show that the bias in the thinking steps is not highly correlated with\nthe output bias (less than $0.6$ correlation with a $p$-value smaller than\n$0.001$ in most cases). In other words, unlike human beings, the tested models\nwith biased decisions do not always possess biased thoughts.",

However, the use of in-generation watermarks in autoregressive\n(AR) image models has not been explored yet. AR models generate images by\nautoregressively predicting a sequence of visual tokens that are then decoded\ninto pixels using a vector-quantized decoder. Inspired by red-green watermarks\nfor large language models, we examine token-level watermarking schemes that\nbias the next-token prediction based on prior tokens. We find that a direct\ntransfer of these schemes works in principle, but the detectability of the\nwatermarks decreases considerably under common image perturbations. As a\nremedy, we propose two novel watermarking methods that rely on visual token\nclustering to assign similar tokens to the same set. Firstly, we investigate a\ntraining-free approach that relies on a cluster lookup table, and secondly, we\nfinetune VAE encoders to predict token clusters directly from perturbed images.\nOverall, our experiments show that cluster-level watermarks improve robustness\nagainst perturbations and regeneration attacks while preserving image quality.\nCluster classification further boosts watermark detectability, outperforming a\nset of baselines.

      "abstract": "With the emergence of 6G, mobile networks are becoming increasingly\nheterogeneous and dynamic, necessitating advanced automation for efficient\nmanagement. Intent-Driven Networks (IDNs) address this by translating\nhigh-level intents into optimization policies. Large Language Models (LLMs) can\nenhance this process by understanding complex human instructions to enable\nadaptive, intelligent automation. Given the rapid advancements in Generative AI\n(GenAI), a comprehensive survey of LLM-based IDN architectures in disaggregated\nRadio Access Network (RAN) environments is both timely and critical. This\narticle provides such a survey, along with a case study on a hierarchical\nlearning-enabled IDN architecture that integrates GenAI across three key\nstages: intent processing, intent validation, and intent execution. Unlike most\nexisting approaches that apply GenAI in the form of LLMs for intent processing\nonly, we propose a hierarchical framework that introduces GenAI across all\nthree stages of IDN. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IDN\nmanagement architecture, we present a case study based on the latest GenAI\narchitecture named Mamba. The case study shows how the proposed GenAI-driven\narchitecture enhances network performance through intelligent automation,\nsurpassing the performance of the conventional IDN architectures.",

      "title": "Deep Ignorance: Filtering Pretraining Data Builds Tamper-Resistant Safeguards into Open-Weight LLMs",
      "abstract": "Open-weight AI systems offer unique benefits, including enhanced\ntransparency, open research, and decentralized access. However, they are\nvulnerable to tampering attacks which can efficiently elicit harmful behaviors\nby modifying weights or activations. Currently, there is not yet a robust\nscience of open-weight model risk management. Existing safety fine-tuning\nmethods and other post-training techniques have struggled to make LLMs\nresistant to more than a few dozen steps of adversarial fine-tuning. In this\npaper, we investigate whether filtering text about dual-use topics from\ntraining data can prevent unwanted capabilities and serve as a more\ntamper-resistant safeguard. We introduce a multi-stage pipeline for scalable\ndata filtering and show that it offers a tractable and effective method for\nminimizing biothreat proxy knowledge in LLMs. We pretrain multiple\n6.9B-parameter models from scratch and find that they exhibit substantial\nresistance to adversarial fine-tuning attacks on up to 10,000 steps and 300M\ntokens of biothreat-related text -- outperforming existing post-training\nbaselines by over an order of magnitude -- with no observed degradation to\nunrelated capabilities. However, while filtered models lack internalized\ndangerous knowledge, we find that they can still leverage such information when\nit is provided in context (e.g., via search tool augmentation), demonstrating a\nneed for a defense-in-depth approach. Overall, these findings help to establish\npretraining data curation as a promising layer of defense for open-weight AI\nsystems.",

      "title": "Effective Training Data Synthesis for Improving MLLM Chart Understanding",
      "abstract": "Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a\ncentral part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are\nstill falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging\nbenchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are\noften restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could\ncompromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this\nstudy, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual\ndetails improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a\nfive-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation\nfor single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on\nearlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated\nfigures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer\n(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of\nfine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which\ncontains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring\n250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD\nconsistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world\nand synthetic test sets.

      "abstract": "Deep-Research agents, which integrate large language models (LLMs) with\nsearch tools, have shown success in improving the effectiveness of handling\ncomplex queries that require iterative search planning and reasoning over\nsearch results. Evaluations on current benchmarks like BrowseComp relies on\nblack-box live web search APIs, have notable limitations in (1) fairness:\ndynamic and opaque web APIs hinder fair comparisons and reproducibility of deep\nresearch methods; (2) transparency: lack of control over the document corpus\nmakes it difficult to isolate retriever contributions. In other words, the\ncurrent evaluations may compare a complete deep research system at a given\ntime, but they do not foster well-controlled experiments to provide insights\ninto the capability of underlying deep research LLMs. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce BrowseComp-Plus, a benchmark derived from BrowseComp,\nemploying a fixed, carefully curated corpus. Each query in BrowseComp-Plus\nincludes human-verified supporting documents and mined challenging negatives,\nenabling controlled experimentation. The benchmark is shown to be effective in\ndistinguishing the performance of deep research systems. For instance, the\nopen-source model Search-R1, when paired with the BM25 retriever, achieves\n3.86% accuracy, whereas the GPT-5 achieves 55.9%. Integrating the GPT-5 with\nthe Qwen3-Embedding-8B retriever further enhances its accuracy to 70.1% with\nfewer search calls. This benchmark allows comprehensive evaluation and\ndisentangled analysis of deep research agents and retrieval methods, fostering\ninsights into retrieval effectiveness, citation accuracy, and context\nengineering in Deep-Research system.",

Yet, participants frequently failed to detect critical flaws\nthat could compromise decision-making, many of which required no technical\nknowledge to recognize. To investigate why, we reformatted AI responses into\nclearly delineated steps and provided alternative approaches for each decision\nto support critical evaluation. While these changes had a positive effect,\nparticipants often struggled to reason through the AI's steps and alternatives.\nOur findings suggest that business professionals cannot reliably verify\nAI-generated data analyses on their own and explore reasons why to inform\nfuture designs.

But their deployment in psychiatric\ncontexts raises a distinctive ethical concern: the problem of atypicality.\nBecause LLMs generate outputs based on population-level statistical\nregularities, their responses -- while typically appropriate for general users\n-- may be dangerously inappropriate when interpreted by psychiatric patients,\nwho often exhibit atypical cognitive or interpretive patterns. We argue that\nstandard mitigation strategies, such as prompt engineering or fine-tuning, are\ninsufficient to resolve this structural risk. Instead, we propose dynamic\ncontextual certification (DCC): a staged, reversible and context-sensitive\nframework for deploying LLMs in psychiatry, inspired by clinical translation\nand dynamic safety models from artificial intelligence governance. DCC reframes\nchatbot deployment as an ongoing epistemic and ethical process that prioritises\ninterpretive safety over static performance benchmarks.

      "abstract": "Haptic captioning is the task of generating natural language descriptions\nfrom haptic signals, such as vibrations, for use in virtual reality,\naccessibility, and rehabilitation applications. While previous multimodal\nresearch has focused primarily on vision and audio, haptic signals for the\nsense of touch remain underexplored. To address this gap, we formalize the\nhaptic captioning task and propose HapticLLaMA, a multimodal sensory language\nmodel that interprets vibration signals into descriptions in a given sensory,\nemotional, or associative category. We investigate two types of haptic\ntokenizers, a frequency-based tokenizer and an EnCodec-based tokenizer, that\nconvert haptic signals into sequences of discrete units, enabling their\nintegration with the LLaMA model. HapticLLaMA is trained in two stages: (1)\nsupervised fine-tuning using the LLaMA architecture with LoRA-based adaptation,\nand (2) fine-tuning via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We\nassess HapticLLaMA's captioning performance using both automated n-gram metrics\nand human evaluation. HapticLLaMA demonstrates strong capability in\ninterpreting haptic vibration signals, achieving a METEOR score of 59.98 and a\nBLEU-4 score of 32.06 respectively. Additionally, over 61% of the generated\ncaptions received human ratings above 3.5 on a 7-point scale, with RLHF\nyielding a 10% improvement in the overall rating distribution, indicating\nstronger alignment with human haptic perception.

In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent\nbuilt on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts\nthat simulate real-world fraud scenarios.

      "abstract": "Long-context inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily limited by\nhigh computational demands. While several existing methods optimize attention\ncomputation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer,\nlimiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative\nframework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical\nprompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information\ndiffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through\nlayers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion\nprocess suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive\ntokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states.\nMotivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning\nmechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at\nintermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous\nKV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex\npredictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs. Extensive experiments\nshow that SlimInfer can achieve up to $\\mathbf{2.53\\times}$ time-to-first-token\n(TTFT) speedup and $\\mathbf{1.88\\times}$ end-to-end latency reduction for\nLLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct on a single RTX 4090, without sacrificing performance on\nLongBench.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are transforming social-science research by\nenabling scalable, precise analysis. Their adaptability raises the question of\nwhether knowledge acquired through fine-tuning in a few languages can transfer\nto unseen languages that only appeared during pre-training. To examine this, we\nfine-tune lightweight LLaMA 3.2-3B models on monolingual, bilingual, or\nmultilingual data sets to classify immigration-related tweets from X/Twitter\nacross 13 languages, a domain characterised by polarised, culturally specific\ndiscourse. We evaluate whether minimal language-specific fine-tuning enables\ncross-lingual topic detection and whether adding targeted languages corrects\npre-training biases. Results show that LLMs fine-tuned in one or two languages\ncan reliably classify immigration-related content in unseen languages. However,\nidentifying whether a tweet expresses a pro- or anti-immigration stance\nbenefits from multilingual fine-tuning. Pre-training bias favours dominant\nlanguages, but even minimal exposure to under-represented languages during\nfine-tuning (as little as $9.62\\times10^{-11}$ of the original pre-training\ntoken volume) yields significant gains. These findings challenge the assumption\nthat cross-lingual mastery requires extensive multilingual training: limited\nlanguage coverage suffices for topic-level generalisation, and structural\nbiases can be corrected with lightweight interventions.

We introduce\nChatAnime, the first Emotionally Supportive Role-Playing (ESRP) dataset. We\nfirst thoughtfully select 20 top-tier characters from popular anime communities\nand design 60 emotion-centric real-world scenario questions. Then, we execute a\nnationwide selection process to identify 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts with\nprofound knowledge of specific characters and extensive experience in\nrole-playing. Next, we systematically collect two rounds of dialogue data from\n10 LLMs and these 40 Chinese anime enthusiasts.

      "abstract": "The Speaker Diarization and Recognition (SDR) task aims to predict \"who spoke\nwhen and what\" within an audio clip, which is a crucial task in various\nreal-world multi-speaker scenarios such as meeting transcription and dialogue\nsystems. Existing SDR systems typically adopt a cascaded framework, combining\nmultiple modules such as speaker diarization (SD) and automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR). The cascaded systems suffer from several limitations, such\nas error propagation, difficulty in handling overlapping speech, and lack of\njoint optimization for exploring the synergy between SD and ASR tasks. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce SpeakerLM, a unified multimodal large\nlanguage model for SDR that jointly performs SD and ASR in an end-to-end\nmanner. Moreover, to facilitate diverse real-world scenarios, we incorporate a\nflexible speaker registration mechanism into SpeakerLM, enabling SDR under\ndifferent speaker registration settings. SpeakerLM is progressively developed\nwith a multi-stage training strategy on large-scale real data. Extensive\nexperiments show that SpeakerLM demonstrates strong data scaling capability and\ngeneralizability, outperforming state-of-the-art cascaded baselines on both\nin-domain and out-of-domain public SDR benchmarks. Furthermore, experimental\nresults show that the proposed speaker registration mechanism effectively\nensures robust SDR performance of SpeakerLM across diverse speaker registration\nconditions and varying numbers of registered speakers.",

Legal Knowledge Graphs (KGs) would be a\nvaluable tool to facilitate access to legal information, to be queried and\nexploited for the purpose, and to enable advanced reasoning and machine\nlearning applications. Indeed, legal KGs may act as knowledge intensive\ncomponent to be used by pre-dictive machine learning solutions supporting the\ndecision process of the legal expert. Nevertheless, a few KGs can be found in\nthe legal domain. To fill this gap, we developed a legal KG targeting legal\ncases of violence against women, along with clear adopted methodologies.\nSpecifically, the paper introduces two complementary approaches for automated\nlegal KG construction; a systematic bottom-up approach, customized for the\nlegal domain, and a new solution leveraging Large Language Models. Starting\nfrom legal sentences publicly available from the European Court of Justice, the\nsolutions integrate structured data extraction, ontology development, and\nsemantic enrichment to produce KGs tailored for legal cases involving violence\nagainst women. After analyzing and comparing the results of the two approaches,\nthe developed KGs are validated via suitable competency questions. The obtained\nKG may be impactful for multiple purposes: can improve the accessibility to\nlegal information both to humans and machine, can enable complex queries and\nmay constitute an important knowledge component to be possibly exploited by\nmachine learning tools tailored for predictive justice.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in reasoning,\nplanning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness a critical\nconcern. The potential for intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately\nfabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective, remains a\nsignificant and underexplored threat. Existing studies typically induce such\ndeception by explicitly setting a \"hidden\" objective through prompting or\nfine-tuning, which may not fully reflect real-world human-LLM interactions.\nMoving beyond this human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated\ndeception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth in this\nevaluation, we propose a novel framework using \"contact searching questions.\"\nThis framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological\nprinciples to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive\nIntention Score, measures the model's bias towards a hidden objective. The\nsecond, Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's\ninternal belief and its expressed output. Upon evaluating 14 leading LLMs, we\nfind that both metrics escalate as task difficulty increases, rising in\nparallel for most models. Building on these findings, we formulate a\nmathematical model to explain this behavior. These results reveal that even the\nmost advanced LLMs exhibit an increasing tendency toward deception when\nhandling complex problems, raising critical concerns for the deployment of LLM\nagents in complex and crucial domains.",

      "abstract": "Designing socially active streets has long been a goal of urban planning, yet\nexisting quantitative research largely measures pedestrian volume rather than\nthe quality of social interactions. We hypothesize that street view imagery --\nan inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social\ninformation that can be extracted and interpreted through established social\nscience theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images\nfrom 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's\ntaxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative\nexample of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or\ncomplemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression\nmodels, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian\ncounts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with\ncity-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with\nenvironmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived\nfrom individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban\nplanning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability\ntypes, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place\nattachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results\nprovide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer\nrelationships between specific types of social interactions and built\nenvironment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as\na scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling\ncross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant\ncities.",

      "title": "KV Cache Compression for Inference Efficiency in LLMs: A Review",
      "abstract": "Withtherapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), the context length\nfor inference has been continuously increasing, leading to an exponential\ngrowth in the demand for Key-Value (KV) caching. This has resulted in a\nsignificant memory bottleneck, limiting the inference efficiency and\nscalability of the models. Therefore, optimizing the KV cache during inference\nis crucial for enhancing performance and efficiency. This review systematically\nexamines current KV cache optimization techniques, including compression\nstrategies such as selective token strategies, quantization, and attention\ncompression. We evaluate the effectiveness, trade-offs, and application\nscenarios of these methods, providing a comprehensive analysis of their impact\non memory usage and inference speed. We focus on identifying the limitations\nand challenges of existing methods, such as compatibility issues with different\nmodels and tasks. Additionally, this review highlights future research\ndirections, including hybrid optimization techniques, adaptive dynamic\nstrategies, and software-hardware co-design. These approaches aim to improve\ninference efficiency and promote the practical application of large language\nmodels.",

In this work, we propose leveraging large\nlanguage models (LLMs) as pseudo-raters for speech quality to address these\ndata bottlenecks.

We compare three training strategies: using human-labeled\ndata, using LLM-labeled data, and a two-stage approach (pretraining on LLM\nlabels, then fine-tuning on human labels), using both DNSMOS Pro and DeePMOS.\nWe test on several datasets across languages and quality degradations. While\nLLM-labeled training yields mixed results compared to human-labeled training,\nwe provide empirical evidence that the two-stage approach improves the\ngeneralization performance (e.g., DNSMOS Pro achieves 0.63 vs. 0.55 PCC on\nNISQA_TEST_LIVETALK and 0.73 vs. 0.65 PCC on Tencent with reverb).

To deal with the limitations, we\nintroduce Llasa+, an accelerated and streaming TTS model built on Llasa.\nSpecifically, to accelerate the generation process, we introduce two\nplug-and-play Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) modules following the frozen\nbackbone.

To bridge these gaps, we present the GeoLaux\nbenchmark, comprising 2,186 geometry problems, incorporating both calculation\nand proving questions. Notably, the problems require an average of 6.51\nreasoning steps, with a maximum of 24 steps, and 41.8% of them need auxiliary\nline construction. Building on the dataset, we design a novel five-dimensional\nevaluation strategy assessing answer correctness, process correctness, process\nquality, auxiliary line impact, and error causes. Extensive experiments on 13\nleading MLLMs (including thinking models and non-thinking models) yield three\npivotal findings: First, models exhibit substantial performance degradation in\nextended reasoning steps (nine models demonstrate over 50% performance drop).\nSecond, compared to calculation problems, MLLMs tend to take shortcuts when\nsolving proving problems. Third, models lack auxiliary line awareness, and\nenhancing this capability proves particularly beneficial for overall geometry\nreasoning improvement.

To overcome these issues, we introduce LoRA in LoRA\n(LiLoRA), a highly efficient architecture expansion method tailored for CVIT in\nMLLMs. LiLoRA shares the LoRA matrix A across tasks to reduce redundancy,\napplies an additional low-rank decomposition to matrix B to minimize\ntask-specific parameters, and incorporates a cosine-regularized stability loss\nto preserve consistency in shared representations over time. Extensive\nexperiments on a diverse CVIT benchmark show that LiLoRA consistently achieves\nsuperior performance in sequential task learning while significantly improving\nparameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.",

While continuing pre-training on large\ncorpora or employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven\nsuccessful, updating an LLM with only a few thousand or million tokens remains\nchallenging. In this work, we investigate the task of injecting small,\nunstructured information into LLMs and its relation to the catastrophic\nforgetting phenomenon. We use a dataset of recent news -- ensuring no overlap\nwith the model's pre-training data -- to evaluate the knowledge acquisition by\nprobing the model with question-answer pairs related the learned information.\nStarting from a continued pre-training baseline, we explored different\naugmentation algorithms to generate synthetic data to improve the knowledge\nacquisition capabilities. Our experiments show that simply continuing\npre-training on limited data yields modest improvements, whereas exposing the\nmodel to diverse textual variations significantly improves the learning of new\nfacts -- particularly with methods that induce greater variability through\ndiverse prompting. Furthermore, we shed light on the forgetting phenomenon in\nsmall-data regimes, illustrating the delicate balance between learning new\ncontent and retaining existing capabilities. We also confirm the sensitivity of\nRAG-based approaches for knowledge injection, which often lead to greater\ndegradation on control datasets compared to parametric methods.

With the emergence of large language models\n(LLMs) in communicative contexts, this understanding needs to be further\nrefined and methodologically reconsidered. The first section challenges the\ntraditional semiotic trichotomy, arguing that connectionist LLM architectures\ndestabilize established hierarchies of meaning, and proposes the Human-Machine\nCommunication (HMC) framework as a more suitable alternative. The second\nsection examines the tension between human-centred pragmatic theories and the\nmachine-centred nature of LLMs. While traditional, Gricean-inspired pragmatics\ncontinue to dominate, it relies on human-specific assumptions ill-suited to\npredictive systems like LLMs. Probabilistic pragmatics, particularly the\nRational Speech Act framework, offers a more compatible teleology by focusing\non optimization rather than truth-evaluation. The third section addresses the\nissue of substitutionalism in three forms - generalizing, linguistic, and\ncommunicative - highlighting the anthropomorphic biases that distort LLM\nevaluation and obscure the role of human communicative subjects. Finally, the\npaper introduces the concept of context frustration to describe the paradox of\nincreased contextual input paired with a collapse in contextual understanding,\nemphasizing how users are compelled to co-construct pragmatic conditions both\nfor the model and themselves.

These attacks easily bypass existing\ndefenses that rely on white-box access, posing a serious security challenge. To\naddress this, we propose SLIP, a Soft Label mechanism and key-extraction-guided\nCoT-based defense against Instruction backdoors in APIs. SLIP is designed based\non two key insights. First, to counteract the model's oversensitivity to\ntriggers, we propose a Key-extraction-guided Chain-of-Thought (KCoT). Instead\nof only considering the single trigger or the input sentence, KCoT prompts the\nagent to extract task-relevant key phrases. Second, to guide the LLM toward\ncorrect answers, our proposed Soft Label Mechanism (SLM) prompts the agent to\nquantify the semantic correlation between key phrases and candidate answers.\nCrucially, to mitigate the influence of residual triggers or misleading content\nin phrases extracted by KCoT, which typically causes anomalous scores, SLM\nexcludes anomalous scores deviating significantly from the mean and\nsubsequently averages the remaining scores to derive a more reliable semantic\nrepresentation. Extensive experiments on classification and question-answer\n(QA) tasks demonstrate that SLIP is highly effective, reducing the average\nattack success rate (ASR) from 90.2% to 25.13% while maintaining high accuracy\non clean data and outperforming state-of-the-art defenses.

      "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs), the safety concerns of their outputs have earned significant\nattention. Although numerous datasets have been proposed, they may become\noutdated with MLLM advancements and are susceptible to data contamination\nissues. To address these problems, we propose \\textbf{SDEval}, the\n\\textit{first} safety dynamic evaluation framework to controllably adjust the\ndistribution and complexity of safety benchmarks. Specifically, SDEval mainly\nadopts three dynamic strategies: text, image, and text-image dynamics to\ngenerate new samples from original benchmarks. We first explore the individual\neffects of text and image dynamics on model safety. Then, we find that\ninjecting text dynamics into images can further impact safety, and conversely,\ninjecting image dynamics into text also leads to safety risks. SDEval is\ngeneral enough to be applied to various existing safety and even capability\nbenchmarks. Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and\ncapability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly\ninfluences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety\nlimitations of MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hq-King/SDEval",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a fundamental technique for compressing large\nlanguage models (LLMs) into compact, efficient student models. However,\nexisting white-box KD methods mainly focus on balancing ground truth and\nstudent-generated responses while overlooking two critical factors: training\ndata quality and student-model compatibility. To address these limitations, we\npropose Selective Reflection Distillation (SRD), a novel data curation\nframework that leverages reflections from student models to systematically\nrefine training data. SRD dynamically evaluates and selects prompt-response\npairs by comparing ground truth data with student model outputs, selectively\ncurating high-quality, student-compatible training instances through automated\nranking based on difficulty. Furthermore, after selecting the training data, a\ncurriculum scheduling strategy is employed to incrementally introduce these\ncurated subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals. As a\nplug-and-play enhancement, SRD consistently improves distillation outcomes\nacross diverse white-box KD approaches and model architectures, as well as\ndecreases computational cost significantly during KD training. Experiments on a\nrange of language model benchmarks demonstrate SRD's consistent improvements in\ndistilled model performance, as well as a reduction in training runtime by up\nto 39%, under diverse KD methods and model families. Notably, SRD operates as a\nplug-and-play module, enhancing sample efficiency without modifying underlying\nKD algorithms. Our findings highlight that data quality and compatibility are\npivotal to effective and efficient distillation of LLMs, and SRD provides a\nprincipled framework to achieve both. This work advances the understanding of\ndata-centric factors in KD and offers practical insights for enhancing the\ncapability and efficiency of compressed LLMs.",

In LLM serving, the\nprefill length corresponds to the input prompt length, which determines the\ninitial memory usage in the KV cache. The decode length refers to the number of\noutput tokens generated sequentially, with each additional token increasing the\nKV cache memory usage by one unit. Given a set of n requests, our goal is to\nschedule and process them to minimize the total completion time. We show that\nthis problem is NP-hard due to the interplay of batching, placement\nconstraints, precedence relationships, and linearly increasing memory usage. We\nthen analyze commonly used scheduling strategies in practice, such as\nFirst-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-First (SF), and prove that their\ncompetitive ratios scale up sublinearly with the memory limit-a significant\ndrawback in real-world settings where memory demand is large. To address this,\nwe propose a novel algorithm based on a new selection metric that efficiently\nforms batches over time. We prove that this algorithm achieves a constant\ncompetitive ratio. Finally, we develop and evaluate a few algorithm variants\ninspired by this approach, including dynamic programming variants, local search\nmethods, and an LP-based scheduler, demonstrating through comprehensive\nsimulations that they outperform standard baselines while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency.",

We introduce SKATE: a novel evaluation\nframework in which large language models (LLMs) compete by generating and\nsolving verifiable tasks for one another. Our core insight is to treat\nevaluation as a game: models act as both task-setters and solvers, incentivized\nto create questions which highlight their own strengths while exposing others'\nweaknesses. SKATE offers several key advantages, balancing scalability,\nopen-endedness, and objectivity. It is fully automated, data-free, and\nscalable, requiring no human input or domain expertise. By using verifiable\ntasks rather than LLM judges, scoring is objective. Unlike domain-limited\nprogrammatically-generated benchmarks (e.g. chess-playing or spatial\nreasoning), having LLMs creatively pose challenges enables open-ended and\nscalable evaluation. As a proof of concept, we introduce LLM-set\ncode-output-prediction (COP) challenges as a verifiable and extensible\nframework in which to test our approach. Using a TrueSkill-based ranking\nsystem, we evaluate six frontier LLMs and find that: (1) weaker models can\nreliably differentiate and score stronger ones, (2) LLM-based systems are\ncapable of self-preferencing behavior, generating questions that align with\ntheir own capabilities, and (3) SKATE automatically surfaces fine-grained\ncapability differences between models.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination, generating\nfactually incorrect statements when handling questions beyond their knowledge\nand perception. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by\nretrieving query-relevant contexts from knowledge bases to support LLM\nreasoning. Recent advances leverage pre-constructed graphs to capture the\nrelational connections among distributed documents, showing remarkable\nperformance in complex tasks. However, existing Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG)\nmethods rely on a costly process to transform the corpus into a graph,\nintroducing overwhelming token cost and update latency. Moreover, real-world\nqueries vary in type and complexity, requiring different logic structures for\naccurate reasoning. The pre-built graph may not align with these required\nstructures, resulting in ineffective knowledge retrieval.

LogicRAG begins by decomposing the input query\ninto a set of subproblems and constructing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to\nmodel the logical dependencies among them. To support coherent multi-step\nreasoning, LogicRAG then linearizes the graph using topological sort, so that\nsubproblems can be addressed in a logically consistent order. Besides, LogicRAG\napplies graph pruning to reduce redundant retrieval and uses context pruning to\nfilter irrelevant context, significantly reducing the overall token cost.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that LogicRAG achieves both superior\nperformance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

While significant\nadvancements have been made in improving retrieval accuracy and response\nquality, a critical challenge remains that the internal knowledge integration\nand retrieval-generation interactions in RAG workflows are largely opaque. This\npaper introduces RAGTrace, an interactive evaluation system designed to analyze\nretrieval and generation dynamics in RAG-based workflows. Informed by a\ncomprehensive literature review and expert interviews, the system supports a\nmulti-level analysis approach, ranging from high-level performance evaluation\nto fine-grained examination of retrieval relevance, generation fidelity, and\ncross-component interactions. Unlike conventional evaluation practices that\nfocus on isolated retrieval or generation quality assessments, RAGTrace enables\nan integrated exploration of retrieval-generation relationships, allowing users\nto trace knowledge sources and identify potential failure cases. The system's\nworkflow allows users to build, evaluate, and iterate on retrieval processes\ntailored to their specific domains of interest. The effectiveness of the system\nis demonstrated through case studies and expert evaluations on real-world RAG\napplications.",

Accurate story evaluation\nis crucial not only for assisting human quality judgment but also for providing\nkey signals to guide story generation. However, existing methods face a\ndilemma: prompt engineering for closed-source models suffers from poor\nadaptability, while fine-tuning approaches for open-source models lack the\nrigorous reasoning capabilities essential for story evaluation. To address\nthis, we propose the Self-Evolving Pairwise Reasoning (EvolvR) framework.\nGrounded in pairwise comparison, the framework first self-synthesizes\nscore-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data via a multi-persona strategy. To\nensure data quality, these raw CoTs undergo a self-filtering process, utilizing\nmulti-agents to guarantee their logical rigor and robustness.

In a game such as StarCraftII (SC2),\nagents need to manage resource constraints and adapt to evolving battlefield\nsituations in a partially observable environment.

To address these challenges, we propose a\nhierarchical multi-agent framework that employs specialized imitation learning\nagents under a meta-controller called Strategic Planner (SP).

While\nprevious efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or\nleveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise\nperformance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose\nFourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual\nrepresentations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the\nobservation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit\nconcentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a\nlow-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimensional Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier\nTransform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)$,\nminimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional\nparameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong\ngeneralizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) acquire knowledge across diverse domains such as\nscience, history, and geography encountered during generative pre-training.\nHowever, due to their stochasticity, it is difficult to predict what LLMs have\nacquired. Prior work has developed different ways to probe this knowledge by\ninvestigating the hidden representations, crafting specific task prompts,\ncurating representative samples, and estimating their uncertainty. However,\nthese methods require making forward passes through the underlying model to\nprobe the LLM's knowledge about a specific fact, making them computationally\nexpensive and time-consuming.

Comprehensive evaluation on $3$ Wikipedia-derived\ndatasets, $4$ LLMs, and $7$ embedding models shows that embeddings can predict\nLLM knowledge on a held-out set with up to 90 % accuracy. Furthermore, we find\nthat sentence embedding models are more suitable than graph embeddings to\npredict LLM knowledge, shedding light on the underlying representation of the\nfactual landscape.

In this study, we propose\nMedOrch, a mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration framework for medical\nmultimodal decision-making. MedOrch employs an LLM-based mediator agent that\nenables multiple VLM-based expert agents to exchange and reflect on their\noutputs towards collaboration. We utilize multiple open-source general-purpose\nand domain-specific VLMs instead of costly GPT-series models, revealing the\nstrength of heterogeneous models. We show that the collaboration within\ndistinct VLM-based agents can surpass the capabilities of any individual agent.\nWe validate our approach on five medical vision question answering benchmarks,\ndemonstrating superior collaboration performance without model training. Our\nfindings underscore the value of mediator-guided multi-agent collaboration in\nadvancing medical multimodal intelligence. Our code will be made publicly\navailable.",

In\nthis work, we propose MCTS-OPS, a novel neural-symbolic framework that\nformulates prompt selection as a sequential decision process guided by MCTS.\nOur method explores and refines multi-step prompt sequences for the goal of\nimproving code generation quality and enhancing the problem-solving\ncapabilities of LLMs in general optimization. Experiments on network\noptimization show significant improvement over the baselines, both in the\nsuccess rate of executing the generated code and in the optimization results\nwith the specified objective and constraints (2$\\sim$4$\\times$ higher reward\nand 3$\\times$ lower standard deviation). Moreover, it improves the chance of\nattaining the optimal solution by about 10\\% of cases, compared to baseline\nmethods in hard problems.

In this study, we tackle the MER-SEMI challenge of the MER2025\ncompetition by proposing a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework. To\naddress the issue of data scarcity, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models\nto extract informative features from visual, audio, and textual modalities.\nSpecifically, for the visual modality, we design a dual-branch visual encoder\nthat captures both global frame-level features and localized facial\nrepresentations.

To effectively integrate these multimodal features, we propose a\nfusion strategy comprising two key components, i.e., self-attention mechanisms\nfor dynamic modality weighting, and residual connections to preserve original\nrepresentations. Beyond architectural design, we further refine noisy labels in\nthe training set by a multi-source labeling strategy.

GRPO, achieving performance gains of +2.5% on\nQwen-Math-7B-Base, +2.2% on Llama-3.2-3B-Base, and +2.4% on\nQwen-Math-1.5B-Instruct. Most critically, while standard GRPO fails to learn\nunder 20% synthetic reward noise, S-GRPO maintains stable learning progress.\nThese results highlight S-GRPO's potential for more robust and effective\ntraining of large-scale reasoning models. \\footnote{Code and data are available\nat: https://github.com/shenpeijun0212/S-GRPO",

      "abstract": "The conversational capabilities of large language models hold significant\npromise for enabling scalable and interactive tutoring. While prior research\nhas primarily examined their capacity for Socratic questioning, it often\noverlooks a critical dimension: adaptively guiding learners based on their\ncognitive states. This study shifts focus from mere question generation to the\nbroader instructional guidance capability. We ask: Can LLMs emulate expert\ntutors who dynamically adjust strategies in response to learners'\nunderstanding? To investigate this, we propose GuideEval, a benchmark grounded\nin authentic educational dialogues that evaluates pedagogical guidance through\na three-phase behavioral framework: (1) Perception, inferring learner states;\n(2) Orchestration, adapting instructional strategies; and (3) Elicitation,\nstimulating proper reflections. Empirical findings reveal that existing LLMs\nfrequently fail to provide effective adaptive scaffolding when learners exhibit\nconfusion or require redirection. Furthermore, we introduce a behavior-guided\nfinetuning strategy that leverages behavior-prompted instructional dialogues,\nsignificantly enhancing guidance performance. By shifting the focus from\nisolated content evaluation to learner-centered interaction, our work advocates\na more dialogic paradigm for evaluating Socratic LLMs.",

Most of these studies, however,\napproach emotion-related tasks in a supervised manner, assessing or training\nthe capabilities of LLMs using discrete emotion labels associated with stimuli\n(e.g., text, images, video, audio). Evaluation studies, in particular, have\noften been limited to standard and superficial emotion-related tasks, such as\nthe recognition of evoked or expressed emotions. In this paper, we move beyond\nsurface-level emotion tasks to investigate how LLMs reason about emotions\nthrough cognitive dimensions. Drawing from cognitive appraisal theory, we\nexamine whether LLMs produce coherent and plausible cognitive reasoning when\nreasoning about emotionally charged stimuli. We introduce a large-scale\nbenchmark on Cognitive Reasoning for Emotions - CoRE - to evaluate internal\ncognitive structures implicitly used by LLMs for emotional reasoning. Through a\nplethora of evaluation experiments and analysis, we seek to answer: (a) Are\nmodels more likely to implicitly rely on specific cognitive appraisal\ndimensions?, (b) What cognitive dimensions are important for characterizing\nspecific emotions?, and, (c) Can the internal representations of different\nemotion categories in LLMs be interpreted through cognitive appraisal\ndimensions?

      "abstract": "Textual Attribute Graphs (TAGs) are critical for modeling complex networks\nlike citation networks, but effective node classification remains challenging\ndue to difficulties in integrating rich semantics from text with structural\ngraph information. Existing methods often struggle with capturing nuanced\ndomain-specific terminology, modeling long-range dependencies, adapting to\ntemporal evolution, and scaling to massive datasets. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel framework that integrates TAPE (Text-Attributed Graph\nRepresentation Enhancement) with Graphormer. Our approach leverages a large\nlanguage model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT, within the TAPE framework to\ngenerate semantically rich explanations from paper content, which are then\nfused into enhanced node representations. These embeddings are combined with\nstructural features using a novel integration layer with learned attention\nweights. Graphormer's path-aware position encoding and multi-head attention\nmechanisms are employed to effectively capture long-range dependencies across\nthe citation network. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on the\nchallenging ogbn-arxiv dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a\nclassification accuracy of 0.772, significantly surpassing the best GCN\nbaseline of 0.713. Our method also yields strong results in precision (0.671),\nrecall (0.577), and F1-score (0.610). We validate our approach through\ncomprehensive ablation studies that quantify the contribution of each\ncomponent, demonstrating the synergy between semantic and structural\ninformation.

As expected, NonMirror models (using life history data) demonstrated\nsmaller effect sizes, but were relatively large (e.g., R2 = .27). When Mirror\nand Non-Mirror model-predicted structured interview depression scores were\ncorrelated with self-reported depression symptoms, Mirror and NonMirror\nperformed the same (e.g., r = ~.54), indicating that Mirror models contain bias\nperhaps due to criterion contamination.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to\npersuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is\nlimited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing\nmodel representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model\nuser sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to\nstudy persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage\ninsights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of\npersuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.\nDespite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of\npersuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can\nidentify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where\npersuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show\nthat in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,\nprobes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such\nas when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible\navenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and\nmanipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset\nanalysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.",

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore\nhuman-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically\ngrounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free\nGeneral Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly\nknowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer\ninteraction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners\nover a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis\nreveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our\nspecially designed \"trap questions\" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's\nshallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct\nlearners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'\nself-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing\nsurprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)\nCritically, the default profile of base LLM is a \"diligent but brittle Surface\nLearner\"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,\ngeneralizable understanding.

      "abstract": "This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation\nfor developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without\ncontinuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust\nhigh-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for\nreward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges\nthat could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The\nproposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated\ndata, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on\nextensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the\nbottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we\nidentify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI\nsystems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to\nchanging circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing\nexternal reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,\nallowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a\nunified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative\nworld models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create\nagents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with\nhuman values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that\ncan develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical\nconstraints.",

We present OmniEAR, a\ncomprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about\nphysical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied\ntasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit\ncollaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire\ncapabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task\ndemands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous\nphysical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios\nspanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals\nsevere performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while\nachieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to\n56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound\ntasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental\ninformation degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter\ntask-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically\n(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing\nfundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied\nreasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can\naddress, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and\nadvancing embodied AI systems.

Currently, there are two mainstream\nreward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both\napproaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while\nmodel-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,\nwe propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework\nthat jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper\nleverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct\nresponses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample\npairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness\nand mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we\nintroduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately\ngenerates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based\nreward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as\ninput. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which\nachieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same\nsize. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our\nexperiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also\nimproves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in\naverage accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct.

      "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential\nsubtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains\nchallenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to\nsupport reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited\ncapacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories\ncaused by fragmented architectures.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought\nframework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a\nsingle unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image\nunderstanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving\nvisual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is\nnon-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To\naddress this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A\nMacro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask\nexecution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines\ninterleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task\nobjectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to\nperform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our\ndesign, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs\nwith 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation\nbenchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT\ndemonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT\nas a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

In this\npaper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy\nevaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed\ntask instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a\nnovel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results\nvalidate the effectiveness of our framework.",

Existing synthesis methods largely rely on\ntransforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.\nWe propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging\nmathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing\nproblems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling\nconcept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and\navoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined\nstrategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts\nreinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning\ncomplexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated\nunder autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,\nencouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with\nlong-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,\ncategorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,\nOlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines\nunder both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused\nvariant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.\nOverall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and\ntransferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in\nadvancing LLM reasoning capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple\nseen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise\nintra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class\nreasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language\nPre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often\nstruggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically\nfail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic\nsemantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)\nframework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive\nmodules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)\nrefines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch\nSelecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only\nimage-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive\nTransfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed\nusing structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs\ngraph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between\nclass representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to\nexplicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive\ninter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class\nrefinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR.

To better understand the interaction between languages in\nthe models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left\nor right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data\nonly. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant\ncross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect.

      "title": "The World According to LLMs: How Geographic Origin Influences LLMs' Entity Deduction Capabilities",
      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit\nbiases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their\npre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted\nquestions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave\nwhen they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a\nmulti-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We\nsystematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction\nusing a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally\nsignificant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We\ntest popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and\nunlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,\nFrench, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs\nare substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North\nthan the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While\nWikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with\nperformance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the\nlanguage in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.\nThese findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation\nframeworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard\nprompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals\nover multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in\ntheir reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/llmbias20q/home.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\na wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive\ntasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring\nspecialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates\nthis by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning\nscenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of\nstructured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from\n\\textit{Discours de la m\\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented\nGeneration (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through\nsystematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,\nLAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by\nlogical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers\nto guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise\ngrounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a\nlogical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering\nunanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive\nreasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified\nresponses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG\nsignificantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns\nLLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to\nexisting RAG systems.",

Current methods, such as\nLLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step\nreasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing\nAgent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,\nare typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this\ngap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task\ncompletion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like\nevaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using\navailable information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module\ncontributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs\nare aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our\nframework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA\nand BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement\nto human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,\nrespectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline.

      "abstract": "LLM-powered code generation has the potential to revolutionize creative\ncoding endeavors, such as live-coding, by enabling users to focus on structural\nmotifs over syntactic details. In such domains, when prompting an LLM, users\nmay benefit from considering multiple varied code candidates to better realize\ntheir musical intentions. Code generation models, however, struggle to present\nunique and diverse code candidates, with no direct insight into the code's\naudio output. To better establish a relationship between code candidates and\nproduced audio, we investigate the topology of the mapping between code and\naudio embedding spaces. We find that code and audio embeddings do not exhibit a\nsimple linear relationship, but supplement this with a constructed predictive\nmodel that shows an embedding alignment map could be learned. Supplementing the\naim for musically diverse output, we present a model that given code predicts\noutput audio embedding, constructing a code-audio embedding alignment map.",

      "abstract": "Interpretability and high performance are essential goals in designing\ncontrol policies, particularly for safety-critical tasks. Deep reinforcement\nlearning has greatly enhanced performance, yet its inherent lack of\ninterpretability often undermines trust and hinders real-world deployment. This\nwork addresses these dual challenges by introducing a novel approach for\nprogrammatic policy discovery, called Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted\nEvolutionary Search (MLES). MLES utilizes multimodal large language models as\npolicy generators, combining them with evolutionary mechanisms for automatic\npolicy optimization. It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis\nwithin the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and\nfacilitate targeted improvements, enhancing the efficiency of policy discovery\nand producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results show that\nMLES achieves policy discovery capabilities and efficiency comparable to\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two control tasks, while offering\ntransparent control logic and traceable design processes. This paradigm\novercomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates\nknowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various control tasks.\nMLES shows promise as a leading approach for the next generation of\ninterpretable control policy discovery.",

However, GRPO\ntreats candidate responses as independent, overlooking semantic interactions\nsuch as complementarity and contradiction. To address this challenge, we first\nintroduce a Structural Causal Model (SCM) that reveals hidden dependencies\namong candidate responses induced by conditioning on a final integrated output\nforming a collider structure. Then, our causal analysis leads to two insights:\n(1) projecting responses onto a causally informed subspace improves prediction\nquality, and (2) this projection yields a better baseline than query only\nconditioning. Building on these insights, we propose Group Causal Policy\nOptimization (GCPO), which integrates causal structure into optimization\nthrough two key components: a causally informed reward adjustment and a novel\nKL regularization term that aligns the policy with a causally projected\nreference distribution. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that\nGCPO consistently surpasses existing methods, including GRPO across multiple\nreasoning benchmarks.",

Applying QCopilot to atom cooling experiments, we generated\n10${}^{\\rm{8}}$ sub-$\\rm{\\mu}$K atoms without any human intervention within a\nfew hours, representing $\\sim$100$\\times$ speedup over manual experimentation.\nNotably, by continuously accumulating prior knowledge and enabling dynamic\nmodeling, QCopilot can autonomously identify anomalous parameters in\nmulti-parameter experimental settings. Our work reduces barriers to large-scale\nquantum sensor deployment and readily extends to other quantum information\nsystems.",

This serial\ncontext switching violates the single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) assumption\nunderlying today's distributed training systems. We present Echo, the RL system\nthat cleanly decouples these two phases across heterogeneous \"inference\" and\n\"training\" swarms while preserving statistical efficiency. Echo introduces two\nlightweight synchronization protocols: a sequential pull mode that refreshes\nsampler weights on every API call for minimal bias, and an asynchronous\npush-pull mode that streams version-tagged rollouts through a replay buffer to\nmaximise hardware utilisation. Training three representative RL workloads with\nQwen3-4B, Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen3-32B on a geographically distributed cluster,\nEcho matches a fully co-located Verl baseline in convergence speed and final\nreward while off-loading trajectory generation to commodity edge hardware.\nThese promising results demonstrate that large-scale RL for LLMs could achieve\ndatacentre-grade performance using decentralised, heterogeneous resources.",

GF-VLA first extracts\nShannon-information-based cues to identify hands and objects with the highest\ntask relevance, then encodes these cues into temporally ordered scene graphs\nthat capture both hand-object and object-object interactions.

In contrast to conventional methods that rely on pre-scheduled action\nsequences or behavior trees, GhostShell drives embodied systems to act\non-the-fly by issuing function calls incrementally as tokens are streamed from\nthe LLM. GhostShell features a streaming XML function token parser, a dynamic\nfunction interface mapper, and a multi-channel scheduler that orchestrates\nintra-channel synchronous and inter-channel asynchronous function calls,\nthereby coordinating serial-parallel embodied actions across multiple robotic\ncomponents under LLM guidance. We evaluate GhostShell on our robotic prototype\nCOCO through comprehensive grounded experiments across 34 real-world\ninteraction tasks and multiple LLM backends. The results demonstrate that our\napproach achieves a state-of-the-art Behavioral Correctness Metric of 0.85 with\nClaude-4-Sonnet, and up to 66X faster response times compared to native LLM\nfunction calling APIs. GhostShell also proves effective in long-horizon\nmultimodal tasks, exhibiting strong robustness and generalization capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the\nfinal step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior\nresearch on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over\nreview reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a\ndecision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing\nthem within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that\ndecision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue\nagents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for\nrealizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,\nwe first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by\ngenerating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a\nself-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert\ndomains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality\nsynthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training\nmeta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue\nagents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform\n\\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our\nagents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness\nin enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\\footnote{Code and Data:\nhttps://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2025-meta-review-as-dialog",

      "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning\ncapabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these\nreasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held \"cascading\nfailure\" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur\nearly in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through\nsystematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive\nphenomenon we term \"Late-Stage Fragility\": errors introduced in the later\nstages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer\nthan identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific\nvulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought\n(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive\nVerification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective\nSelf-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score\nfunction I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the\nreasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and\nprioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are\nidentified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the\nfailure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH\ndemonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong\nbaselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of\ndiagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift\nfrom uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware\ncorrection mechanisms.",

Errors arise from various factors, with limited understanding\nof specific failure causes hindering improvement. To address this, we conduct a\ncomprehensive error analysis and manual categorization. Our findings reveal\nthat most errors stem not from LLM reasoning limitations, but from insufficient\nRTL programming knowledge, poor understanding of circuit concepts, ambiguous\ndesign descriptions, or misinterpretation of complex multimodal inputs.\nLeveraging in-context learning, we propose targeted error correction\ntechniques. Specifically, we construct a domain-specific knowledge base and\nemploy retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to supply necessary RTL knowledge.\nTo mitigate ambiguity errors, we introduce design description rules and\nimplement a rule-checking mechanism.

While recent works have explored MoE compression to\naddress this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy\ndrops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper\nintroduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model\ncompression while incurring minimal accuracy drops. Specifically, each up/gate\nmatrix in an expert is decomposed via a rank decomposition as W = AB, where\nmatrix A is unique to each expert.

The factorization is learned by\nminimizing the reconstruction error relative to the original weight matrices.\nExperiments demonstrate that MoBE achieves notably lower accuracy drops\ncompared to prior works. For instance, MoBE can reduce the parameter counts of\nQwen3-235B-A22B-2507, DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B) and Kimi-K2-Instruct (1T) by\n24%-30% with only 1%-2% accuracy drop (about 2% drops when measured\nrelatively).",

A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform\nefficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification.\nExtensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B\nparameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust\ngeneralization and enhanced interpretability.",

Mainstream benchmarks such as\nHumanEval and MBPP primarily assess functional correctness, while reasoning\nbenchmarks like CRUXEVAL are limited to single-function, low-complexity\nscenarios. As a result, advanced models achieve nearly saturated scores,\nlimiting their discriminative power. To address this, we present\nSTEPWISE-CODEX-Bench (SX-Bench), a novel benchmark designed for complex\nmulti-function understanding and fine-grained execution reasoning. SX-Bench\nfeatures tasks involving collaboration among multiple sub-functions (e.g.,\nchained calls, nested loops), shifting evaluation towards overall control and\ndata flow modeling. It defines \"computation steps\" as the minimal execution\nunit and requires models to predict the total number of steps in reasoning\ntasks, thereby assessing a model's in-depth understanding of dynamic execution\nbeyond simple I/O matching. Evaluation on over 20 mainstream models (including\n14 reasoning-enhanced models) demonstrates that SX-Bench is highly\ndiscriminative: even the state-of-the-art OpenAI-O3 achieves only 78.37 percent\naccuracy on Hard-Reasoning tasks, much lower than its saturated scores on\nprevious benchmarks, thereby revealing bottlenecks in complex and fine-grained\nreasoning. We also release an automated pipeline combining program synthesis,\nsymbolic execution, and LLM-aided validation for efficient benchmark generation\nand quality assurance.

However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based\nrewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning\nprocess. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising\ndirection, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model\nlearns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes.\nTo address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively\nincorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable\nreasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference\npairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score\nreasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method\nfor reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs\nby systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along\ncurated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical\nrigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other\nbenchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method\nthat conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying\nrewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO\neffectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning\nwith final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior\nperformance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only\nbaselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo.

      "abstract": "With the remarkable advancement of AI agents, the number of their equipped\ntools is increasing rapidly. However, integrating all tool information into the\nlimited model context becomes impractical, highlighting the need for efficient\ntool retrieval methods. In this regard, dominant methods primarily rely on\nsemantic similarities between tool descriptions and user queries to retrieve\nrelevant tools. However, they often consider each tool independently,\noverlooking dependencies between tools, which may lead to the omission of\nprerequisite tools for successful task execution. To deal with this defect, in\nthis paper, we propose Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), which exploits the\ndependencies among tools to learn better tool representations for retrieval.\nFirst, we construct a dataset termed TDI300K to train a discriminator for\nidentifying tool dependencies. Then, we represent all candidate tools as a tool\ndependency graph and use graph convolution to integrate the dependencies into\ntheir representations. Finally, these updated tool representations are employed\nfor online retrieval. Experimental results on several commonly used datasets\nshow that our TGR can bring a performance improvement to existing dominant\nmethods, achieving SOTA performance. Moreover, in-depth analyses also verify\nthe importance of tool dependencies and the effectiveness of our TGR.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid and continuous increase in academic publications, identifying\nhigh-quality research has become an increasingly pressing challenge. While\nrecent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper\nevaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated\ndomain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we present\nPaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that\naddresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper\nretrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support\ncontextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent\nreasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and\nmethodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related\nwork, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation. To guide the reasoning\nprocess, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that\nencourages the LLM to iteratively refine its predictions with an emphasis on\nrelative comparison. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PaperEval\nconsistently outperforms existing methods in both academic impact and paper\nquality evaluation. In addition, we deploy PaperEval in a real-world paper\nrecommendation system for filtering high-quality papers, which has gained\nstrong engagement on social media -- amassing over 8,000 subscribers and\nattracting over 10,000 views for many filtered high-quality papers --\ndemonstrating the practical effectiveness of PaperEval.",

      "abstract": "The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to\nthe contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the\nmechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a\nconsistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a\nsequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),\nmodels systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and\nend of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our\nanalysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical\ninformation is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we\nintroduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)\nestimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small\ncalibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to\nalign the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is\na model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal\ncomputational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context\nlearning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements\nacross 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without\nmodifying model parameters or training procedures.",

      "abstract": "Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is\nrapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how\nknowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings\nfrom a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language\nmodel designed to scaffold student research question development through\nstructured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65\npre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with\nthe Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students\nusing the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,\nindependent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate\nmetacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due\nto generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a\nbroader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of\nspecialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of\norchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated\nby educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated\nroles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted\noffer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from\nthese agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level\nimplications for higher education institutions and students, including funding\nnecessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment\npractices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis\nhighlighting the scalability of such systems.

      "abstract": "User feedback is critical for refining recommendation systems, yet explicit\nfeedback (e.g., likes or dislikes) remains scarce in practice. As a more\nfeasible alternative, inferring user preferences from massive implicit feedback\nhas shown great potential (e.g., a user quickly skipping a recommended video\nusually indicates disinterest). Unfortunately, implicit feedback is often\nnoisy: a user might skip a video due to accidental clicks or other reasons,\nrather than disliking it. Such noise can easily misjudge user interests,\nthereby undermining recommendation performance. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel Group-aware User Behavior Simulation (G-UBS) paradigm, which\nleverages contextual guidance from relevant user groups, enabling robust and\nin-depth interpretation of implicit feedback for individual users.\nSpecifically, G-UBS operates via two key agents. First, the User Group Manager\n(UGM) effectively clusters users to generate group profiles utilizing a\n``summarize-cluster-reflect\" workflow based on LLMs. Second, the User Feedback\nModeler (UFM) employs an innovative group-aware reinforcement learning\napproach, where each user is guided by the associated group profiles during the\nreinforcement learning process, allowing UFM to robustly and deeply examine the\nreasons behind implicit feedback. To assess our G-UBS paradigm, we have\nconstructed a Video Recommendation benchmark with Implicit Feedback (IF-VR). To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal benchmark for implicit\nfeedback evaluation in video recommendation, encompassing 15k users, 25k\nvideos, and 933k interaction records with implicit feedback. Extensive\nexperiments on IF-VR demonstrate that G-UBS significantly outperforms\nmainstream LLMs and MLLMs, with a 4.0% higher proportion of videos achieving a\nplay rate > 30% and 14.9% higher reasoning accuracy on IF-VR.",

Current research predominantly focuses on\nmaximizing attack success rate (ASR), often overlooking whether the generated\nresponses actually fulfill the attacker's malicious intent. This oversight\nfrequently leads to low-quality outputs that bypass safety filters but lack\nsubstantial harmful content. To address this gap, we propose JPS,\n\\underline{J}ailbreak MLLMs with collaborative visual \\underline{P}erturbation\nand textual \\underline{S}teering, which achieves jailbreaks via corporation of\nvisual image and textually steering prompt. Specifically, JPS utilizes\ntarget-guided adversarial image perturbations for effective safety bypass,\ncomplemented by \"steering prompt\" optimized via a multi-agent system to\nspecifically guide LLM responses fulfilling the attackers' intent. These visual\nand textual components undergo iterative co-optimization for enhanced\nperformance. To evaluate the quality of attack outcomes, we propose the\nMalicious Intent Fulfillment Rate (MIFR) metric, assessed using a\nReasoning-LLM-based evaluator. Our experiments show JPS sets a new\nstate-of-the-art in both ASR and MIFR across various MLLMs and benchmarks, with\nanalyses confirming its efficacy.

However, as medical knowledge continues to\nevolve, it is critical to allow these models to efficiently update outdated or\nincorrect information without retraining from scratch. Although textual\nknowledge editing has been widely studied, there is still a lack of systematic\nbenchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing involving image and text\nmodalities. To fill this gap, we present MedMKEB, the first comprehensive\nbenchmark designed to evaluate the reliability, generality, locality,\nportability, and robustness of knowledge editing in medical multimodal large\nlanguage models. MedMKEB is built on a high-quality medical visual\nquestion-answering dataset and enriched with carefully constructed editing\ntasks, including counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge\ntransfer, and adversarial robustness. We incorporate human expert validation to\nensure the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark. Extensive single editing\nand sequential editing experiments on state-of-the-art general and medical\nMLLMs demonstrate the limitations of existing knowledge-based editing\napproaches in medicine, highlighting the need to develop specialized editing\nstrategies.

      "abstract": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a\ndiverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by\nmulti-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves\nLoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural\ndiversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct\nchallenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head\narchitecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex\nmulti-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the\nmulti-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard\nsingle-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly\ncompetitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective\nMTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not\nisolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,\nwhich incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the\nshared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly\nsurpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for\nadapting LLMs to multiple tasks.

Yet, the central element guiding this process\n-- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the\nsurrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime\ncontrol.\n  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a\nlanguage and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts\nstructured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model.

It supports multiple refinement modes (manual,\nassisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and\nautomation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables\noptimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse.\nPreliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes\ncompared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of\nprompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.",

Our\nanalysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial\nrelationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and\nsidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they\nstruggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational\ngeometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when\nprovided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,\nLLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a\nreview-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting\nerroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss\npractical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in\nreal-world contexts and outline future research directions, including\npost-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data\nformats.

However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such\nas long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding\nsuicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a\nmulti-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction\nfrom unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art\nlanguage models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning\nmodels (i.e., DeepSeek-R1).

Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model\nachieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs.

      "abstract": "Traditionally, traders and quantitative analysts address alpha decay by\nmanually crafting formulaic alphas, mathematical expressions that identify\npatterns or signals in financial data, through domain expertise and\ntrial-and-error. This process is often time-consuming and difficult to scale.\nWith recent advances in large language models (LLMs), it is now possible to\nautomate the generation of such alphas by leveraging the reasoning capabilities\nof LLMs. This paper introduces a novel framework that integrates a prompt-based\nLLM with a Transformer model for stock price prediction. The LLM first\ngenerates diverse and adaptive alphas using structured inputs such as\nhistorical stock features (Close, Open, High, Low, Volume), technical\nindicators, sentiment scores of both target and related companies. These\nalphas, instead of being used directly for trading, are treated as high-level\nfeatures that capture complex dependencies within the financial data. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of these LLM-generated formulaic alphas, the alpha\nfeatures are then fed into prediction models such as Transformer, LSTM, TCN,\nSVR, and Random Forest to forecast future stock prices. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the LLM-generated alphas significantly improve predictive\naccuracy. Moreover, the accompanying natural language reasoning provided by the\nLLM enhances the interpretability and transparency of the predictions,\nsupporting more informed financial decision-making.",

      "abstract": "The increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), widespread\nadoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), and the growing frequency of extreme\nweather events have significantly increased the complexity of power grid\nplanning, operation, and management. Traditional rule-based systems and\nnumerical optimization approaches often struggle with the scale, dynamics, and\nadaptability required by modern power networks. This paper introduces\nGrid-Agent, an autonomous, AI-driven framework that combines Large Language\nModels (LLMs) with multi-agent reinforcement learning to detect and remediate\ngrid violations in real time. Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with\nnumerical precision through a modular agent architecture: a planning agent\ngenerates coordinated action sequences using numerical power flow solvers,\nwhile a validation agent evaluates system stability and action effectiveness\nvia sandboxed execution with safety rollbacks. To ensure scalability,\nGrid-Agent incorporates an adaptive multiscale network representation that\ndynamically selects optimal encoding schemes based on network size and\ncomplexity. The framework enables coordinated violation resolution through\noptimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment\nstrategies. Experimental results in standard IEEE and CIGRE test systems (IEEE\n69-bus, CIGRE MV, and IEEE 30-bus) demonstrate superior violation mitigation\nperformance. Additionally, the framework's built-in data collection and\nlearning capabilities enable continuous learning and adaptation to diverse\nnetwork topologies. The autonomous nature of the framework makes it\nparticularly suitable for modern smart grid applications requiring rapid\nresponse to dynamic operating conditions.",

Experiments on three\nmulti-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate\nthat RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining\nanswer quality.

While this integration\nleverages rich relational information to improve task performance, their\nrobustness against adversarial attacks remains unexplored. We take the first\nstep to explore the vulnerabilities of graph-aware LLMs by leveraging existing\nadversarial attack methods tailored for graph-based models, including those for\npoisoning (training-time attacks) and evasion (test-time attacks), on two\nrepresentative models, LLAGA (Chen et al. 2024) and GRAPHPROMPTER (Liu et al.\n2024). Additionally, we discover a new attack surface for LLAGA where an\nattacker can inject malicious nodes as placeholders into the node sequence\ntemplate to severely degrade its performance. Our systematic analysis reveals\nthat certain design choices in graph encoding can enhance attack success, with\nspecific findings that: (1) the node sequence template in LLAGA increases its\nvulnerability; (2) the GNN encoder used in GRAPHPROMPTER demonstrates greater\nrobustness; and (3) both approaches remain susceptible to imperceptible feature\nperturbation attacks.

      "abstract": "This paper evaluates the visualization literacy of modern Large Language\nModels (LLMs) and introduces a novel prompting technique called\nCharts-of-Thought. We tested three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude-3.7-sonnet,\nGPT-4.5 preview, and Gemini-2.0-pro) on the Visualization Literacy Assessment\nTest (VLAT) using standard prompts and our structured approach. The\nCharts-of-Thought method guides LLMs through a systematic data extraction,\nverification, and analysis process before answering visualization questions.\nOur results show Claude-3.7-sonnet achieved a score of 50.17 using this method,\nfar exceeding the human baseline of 28.82. This approach improved performance\nacross all models, with score increases of 21.8% for GPT-4.5, 9.4% for\nGemini-2.0, and 13.5% for Claude-3.7 compared to standard prompting. The\nperformance gains were consistent across original and modified VLAT charts,\nwith Claude correctly answering 100% of questions for several chart types that\npreviously challenged LLMs. Our study reveals that modern multimodal LLMs can\nsurpass human performance on visualization literacy tasks when given the proper\nanalytical framework. These findings establish a new benchmark for LLM\nvisualization literacy and demonstrate the importance of structured prompting\nstrategies for complex visual interpretation tasks. Beyond improving LLM\nvisualization literacy, Charts-of-Thought could also enhance the accessibility\nof visualizations, potentially benefiting individuals with visual impairments\nor lower visualization literacy.",

We\npresent PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive\nevaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across\n500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted\npersonality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing,\npersonas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment\nassumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD\n> 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up\nto 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as\nchain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of\nconversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted\ninstruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming\narchitectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent\ninstability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack\nthe foundations for genuine behavioral consistency.

In this study, we evaluate\nthe capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML\nprojects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing\n4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed\nthe original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them,\nand evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text\nquality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we\nmanually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common\npatterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place\nas humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of\n82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level\nlogging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function,\ndifficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with\nproject-specific logging conventions.

However, continual fine-tuning\nLLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,\ncharacterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and\n2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously\naddress both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample\nReplay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient\nanti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices\nunder GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced\nactivation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin\n(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.\nWe are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general\nreplay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general\ncapabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.\nIndeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled\nexperiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies\nunder the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via\nKL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that\nTM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work\npaves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future.

Our Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves\n87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforming larger proprietary models such as\nGPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate substantial improvements on FollowBench\nwhile preserving general capabilities. Our trip wires show significant\nreductions in reward hacking rates. We will release models, code, and data for\nfuture research.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to produce safe, helpful, and\nhonest content during interaction with human users, but they frequently fail to\nalign with such values when given flawed instructions, e.g., missing context,\nambiguous directives, or inappropriate tone, leaving substantial room for\nimprovement along multiple dimensions. A cost-effective yet high-impact way is\nto pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches\neither rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite,\nwhich is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In\nthis work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference\nalignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating\ninstructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more\nhuman-preferred form. P-Aligner is trained on UltraPrompt, a new dataset\nsynthesized via a proposed principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree\nSearch, which systematically explores the space of candidate instructions that\nare closely tied to human preference. Experiments across different methods show\nthat P-Aligner generally outperforms strong baselines across various models and\nbenchmarks, including average win-rate gains of 28.35% and 8.69% on GPT-4-turbo\nand Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively. Further analyses validate its effectiveness\nand efficiency through multiple perspectives, including data quality, search\nstrategies, iterative deployment, and time overhead.",

      "abstract": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines\ninto conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant\nindustrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time\nneeds and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated\ncontent like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static\npages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such\ntime-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static\ncontent, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like\ndatabases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA\n(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage\nframework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content\nand dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an\nIntent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information\nsources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task\nPlanner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for\noptimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for\nefficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge\nthe gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI\nsearch product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic\nframework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency\ndemands of a large-scale industrial system.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their\nhigh computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment.\nExisting compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g.\nlow-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered\nstructure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a\ndimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by\ndictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight\nsharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection\nmatrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's\nparameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods\nrequiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in\nAttention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers\n- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix\natoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves\nbetter benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),\nlow-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at\ncomparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the\ndictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing\ncross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),\nMASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks\nwith 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning\nstrategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for\nparameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we\ninvestigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce\ntheir number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their\nperformance.",

Our benchmark constructs three types of adversarially\nperturbed reasoning steps: Synonym Substitution, Syntactic Transformation, and\nImage Perturbation, to test the robustness of MPJ confidence under\nperturbations. In addition, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics:\nConfidence Robustness Score (CRS), Confidence Sensitivity Score (CSS), and\nConfidence Calibration Score (CCS), which evaluate robustness, sensitivity, and\ncalibration, respectively.

We introduce C-MIND, a clinical\nneuropsychiatric multimodal diagnosis dataset collected over two years from\nreal hospital visits. Each participant completes three structured psychiatric\ntasks and receives a final diagnosis from expert clinicians, with informative\naudio, video, transcript, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)\nsignals recorded.

We train a range of classical models to quantify how different\ntasks and modalities contribute to diagnostic performance, and dissect the\neffectiveness of their combinations. We then explore whether LLMs can perform\npsychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in\nrealistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning\nprocess with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic\nperformance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score.

      "abstract": "Generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses via representation\nediting is a promising way for fine-grained output control. However, there\nexists an inherent trade-off: imposing a distinctive style often degrades\ntruthfulness. Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting\nstyle signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the\nmodel's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer\ncorrectness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse.\nWe attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions\nin certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that\npreserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates\nthe style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation\nspace via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables\nindependent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing\ninterference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each\nsubspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to\nmaintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness. We validate our method on\nmultiple styles and languages. Extensive experiments and analyses show that\nStyliTruth significantly reduces stylization-induced truthfulness collapse and\noutperforms existing inference-time intervention methods in balancing style\nadherence with truthfulness.",

      "title": "TRAIL: Joint Inference and Refinement of Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models",
      "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked powerful\nreasoning and decision-making capabilities. However, their inherent dependence\non static parametric memory fundamentally limits their adaptability, factual\naccuracy, and interpretability in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Knowledge\ngraphs (KGs), as structured repositories of explicit relational knowledge,\noffer a promising approach for augmenting LLMs with external, interpretable\nmemory. Nevertheless, most existing methods that combine LLMs with KGs treat\nreasoning and knowledge updating as separate processes, resulting in suboptimal\nutilization of new information and hindering real-time updates. In this work,\nwe propose TRAIL: a novel, unified framework for Thinking, Reasoning, And\nIncremental Learning that couples joint inference and dynamic KG refinement\nwith large language models. TRAIL enables LLM agents to iteratively explore,\nupdate, and refine knowledge graphs during the reasoning process, employing a\nconfidence-driven mechanism for the generation, validation, and pruning of new\nfacts. This plug-and-play architecture facilitates seamless integration with\nvarious LLMs, supporting continual adaptation without the need for retraining.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TRAIL outperforms\nexisting KG-augmented and retrieval-augmented LLM baselines by 3% to 13%. More\nimportantly, these results represent a significant step toward developing\nadaptive, memory-augmented language models capable of continual learning and\nreliable, transparent reasoning.",

      "abstract": "Speculative decoding (SD), where an extra draft model first provides multiple\ndraft tokens and the original target model then verifies these tokens in\nparallel, has shown great power for LLM inference acceleration. However,\nexisting SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which\nforces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD,\nresulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the\ndraft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is\nrejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be\ndiscarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we\npropose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a\n'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and\nverification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared\ncache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's\ngeneration direction. This effectively enables the target model to perform\ninference at speed approaching that of the draft model. Our approach achieves\nup to 4.83 speedup over vanilla decoding without requiring fine-tuning of\neither the draft or target models. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/hunzhizi/CARD.",

      "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated a latent capacity for complex\nreasoning by spontaneously exhibiting cognitive behaviors such as step-by-step\nreasoning, reflection, and backtracking, commonly referred to as \"Aha Moments\".\nHowever, such emergent behaviors remain unregulated and uncontrolled, often\nresulting in overthinking, where the model continues generating redundant\nreasoning content even after reaching reliable conclusions. This leads to\nexcessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical\ndeployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory\nmechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their\nreasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To\naddress this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),\nwhich explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and\ncontrol components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control\nstrategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction\nmechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and\ndelegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling\nthe construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a\nstructured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised\nfine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial\nmeta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment\nPolicy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control\nbehavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.\nExperiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained\nwith MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.",

Using a curated suite of ten\nreal-world C# projects that embed 63 vulnerabilities across common categories\nsuch as SQL injection, hard-coded secrets and outdated dependencies, we measure\nclassical detection accuracy (precision, recall, F-score), analysis latency,\nand the developer effort required to vet true positives. The language-based\nscanners achieve higher mean F-1 scores,0.797, 0.753 and 0.750, than their\nstatic counterparts, which score 0.260, 0.386 and 0.546, respectively. LLMs'\nadvantage originates from superior recall, confirming an ability to reason\nacross broader code contexts. However, this benefit comes with substantial\ntrade-offs: DeepSeek V3 exhibits the highest false-positive ratio, all language\nmodels mislocate issues at line-or-column granularity due to tokenisation\nartefacts. Overall, language models successfully rival traditional static\nanalysers in finding real vulnerabilities. Still, their noisier output and\nimprecise localisation limit their standalone use in safety-critical audits. We\ntherefore recommend a hybrid pipeline: employ language models early in\ndevelopment for broad, context-aware triage, while reserving deterministic\nrule-based scanners for high-assurance verification.

Recent advancements in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior\nknowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic\nprompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we\nrigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in\nsilico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference\nperformance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly\ntrained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot\nprompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or\nsuperior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,\nparticularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable\nlimitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including\narithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical\nlogic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g.,\nmeals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's\nlimitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through\ntextual inference.

      "abstract": "The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks\nhas raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired\ncapabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit\ntraining. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing\nthe epistemological challenge of \"creation without understanding\" that\ncharacterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's\nreliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic\ncomputational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot\nbe analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of\nscaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,\nI demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly\nsensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My\ninvestigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss\nthresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of\nemergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent\nproperties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where\nsystemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple\ncomponents without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper\nconcludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a\nnew domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of\nemergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This\nperspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of\nemergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable\nthese systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual\ncomponents.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant\nprogress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when\nprocessing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs'\ncontext limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before\nfeeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform\nsampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained\nby the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile,\nbuilding a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised\nand non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these\nproblems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing\nMLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning.\nSpecifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which\ncaptures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe\nselection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which\nmodels keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making\nprocess, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient\nrule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long\nvideo training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and\nvideo Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering\naccuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal\nsampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding\nbenchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge\nVideo-MLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Hui-design/TSPO",

To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative\nReasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from\nprobability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking \"Which\nanswer is most likely?\", DRN asks \"Which hypothesis has the most internally\nconsistent evidence?\". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly\ntracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing\nhypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process.

Experimental\nresults show that MATC achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing\nbenchmarks. We further propose a new benchmark dataset featuring more diverse\ntopics for faithful literature review generation.",

      "abstract": "Rust's compile-time safety guarantees make it ideal for safety-critical\nsystems, creating demand for translating legacy C codebases to Rust. While\nvarious approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs:\nrule-based solutions face challenges in meeting code safety and idiomaticity\nrequirements, while LLM-based solutions often fail to generate semantically\nequivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the\nentire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited\nto small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated\nframework for converting entire C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust\nemploys a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation.\nThe pipeline consists of three evolutionary stages: 1) it first decomposes the\nC project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to\ntransform definitions and macros and generates type-checked function stubs,\nwhich form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates the\nfunction, replacing the corresponding stub placeholder; 3) finally, it repairs\ncompilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary\naugmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and\nLLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six\nindustrial projects demonstrates EvoC2Rust's superior performance in\nproject-level C-to-Rust translation. On average, it achieves 17.24% and 14.32%\nimprovements in syntax and semantic accuracy over the LLM-based approaches,\nalong with a 96.79% higher code safety rate than the rule-based tools. At the\nmodule level, EvoC2Rust reaches 92.25% compilation and 89.53% test pass rates\non industrial projects, even for complex codebases and long functions.",

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we apply Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO), an alignment method that fine-tunes LLMs to prefer\nunperturbed consensus statements.

Earlier reinforcement-learning (RL)\nefforts could, in principle, endow VLMs with such skills, but they have seldom\ntested whether the learned behaviours generalize beyond their training\nsimulators, and they depend either on brittle hyperparameter tuning or on\ndense-reward environments with low state variability. We introduce\nVision-Language Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC), a lightweight,\nhyperparameter-free RL algorithm. VL-DAC applies PPO updates to action tokens\nwhile learning value only at the environment-step level: an arrangement, to our\nknowledge, not previously explored for large VLMs or LLMs. This simple\ndecoupling removes unstable weighting terms and yields faster, more reliable\nconvergence.

This parallel\nraises a fundamental question: if LLMs can model the intact brain, can we\nlesion them to simulate the linguistic deficits of the injured brain? In this\nwork, we introduce a methodology to model aphasia - a complex language disorder\ncaused by neural injury - by selectively disabling components in a modular\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model. We simulate distinct aphasia subtypes,\nvalidate their linguistic outputs against real patient speech, and then\ninvestigate functional recovery by retraining the model's remaining healthy\nexperts. Our results demonstrate that lesioning functionally-specialized\nexperts for syntax or semantics induces distinct impairments that closely\nresemble Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, respectively. Crucially, we show that\nfreezing the damaged experts and retraining the intact ones on conversational\ndata restores significant linguistic function, demonstrating a computational\nanalogue for rehabilitation.

This paper\npresents Sci-OG, a semi-auto\\-mated methodology for generating research topic\nontologies, employing a multi-step approach: 1) Topic Discovery, extracting\npotential topics from research papers; 2) Relationship Classification,\ndetermining semantic relationships between topic pairs; and 3) Ontology\nConstruction, refining and organizing topics into a structured ontology.

While recent advanced large reasoning models like\nDeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,\ntheir reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,\nan attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property\nprediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)\na format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count\nreward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward\nusing advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated\nattributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of\nrelevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for\nthe molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution\nand out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size\nR1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our\nproposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting\ncomparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models\n(Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,\nDeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.).

Yet, this is impractical due to significant\ncomputational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning\nhas emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by\nselectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while\npreserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no\navailable datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection\nin biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark\nMultimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built\nupon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic\nprivate data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets\ntwo key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is\nmistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally\nrespond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where\nwrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset,\nleading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning\nEfficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance\nacross different subsets.

      "abstract": "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable\ncapabilities across diverse domains, their application to specialized anomaly\ndetection (AD) remains constrained by domain adaptation challenges. Existing\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based approaches suffer from two\ncritical limitations: inadequate training data utilization when models produce\nuniform responses, and insufficient supervision over reasoning processes that\nencourage immediate binary decisions without deliberative analysis. We propose\na comprehensive framework addressing these limitations through two synergistic\ninnovations. First, we introduce a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process\nthat guides models from region identification to focused examination,\ngenerating diverse response patterns essential for GRPO optimization while\nenabling structured supervision over analytical workflows. Second, we develop a\nfine-grained reward mechanism incorporating classification accuracy and\nlocalization supervision, transforming binary feedback into continuous signals\nthat distinguish genuine analytical insight from spurious correctness.\nComprehensive evaluation across multiple industrial datasets demonstrates\nsubstantial performance improvements in adapting general vision-language models\nto specialized anomaly detection. Our method achieves superior accuracy with\nefficient adaptation of existing annotations, effectively bridging the gap\nbetween general-purpose MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained visual\ndiscrimination required for detecting subtle manufacturing defects and\nstructural irregularities.",

Existing studies show that incorporating search signals boosts\nrecommendation performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods relies\nheavily on rich search interactions. They primarily benefit a small subset of\nusers with abundant search behavior, while offering limited improvements for\nthe majority of users who exhibit only sparse search activity. To address the\nproblem of sparse search data in search-enhanced recommendation, we face two\nkey challenges: (1) how to learn useful search features for users with sparse\nsearch interactions, and (2) how to design effective training objectives under\nsparse conditions. Our idea is to leverage the features of users with rich\nsearch interactions to enhance those of users with sparse search interactions.\nBased on this idea, we propose GSERec, a method that utilizes message passing\non the User-Code Graphs to alleviate data sparsity in Search-Enhanced\nRecommendation. Specifically, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) with\nvector quantization to generate discrete codes, which connect similar users and\nthereby construct the graph. Through message passing on this graph, embeddings\nof users with rich search data are propagated to enhance the embeddings of\nusers with sparse interactions. To further ensure that the message passing\ncaptures meaningful information from truly similar users, we introduce a\ncontrastive loss to better model user similarities. The enhanced user\nrepresentations are then integrated into downstream search-enhanced\nrecommendation models. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that\nGSERec consistently outperforms baselines, especially for users with sparse\nsearch behaviors.",

However, existing zero-shot TTS\nmodels face challenges in capturing the complex correlations between acoustic\nand semantic features, resulting in a lack of expressiveness and similarity.\nThe primary reason lies in the complex relationship between semantic and\nacoustic features, which manifests independent and interdependent aspects.This\npaper introduces a TTS framework that combines both autoregressive (AR) and\nnon-autoregressive (NAR) modules to harmonize the independence and\ninterdependence of acoustic and semantic information. The AR model leverages\nthe proposed Parallel Tokenizer to synthesize the top semantic and acoustic\ntokens simultaneously.

Parallel GPT, built on this architecture, is designed to improve\nzero-shot text-to-speech synthesis through its parallel structure.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities\nof Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving tasks. Recently, the\nintroduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging\nrule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions\nand guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across\nmany replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses\nunder a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or\nincorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to\nvanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for\nlearning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.\nTo address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization\nframework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome\nconsistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs\nshow high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives\nmeaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and\nself-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we\nincorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances\nlocal advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic\ntransitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method\nintroduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization\nstrategy.

Recent works\nmostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance\ngain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with\nthis, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that\nreformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the\nCategory-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the\nopen-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a\nstructured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features\ndistinguishing closely related classes.

Using it we can convert each\nimage into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature\nrepresentation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot\nsamples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and\ntext encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by\nretrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad\ncompatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization\nand adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios.

However, LLMs still face challenges in spatial\nconsistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias. To address these issues,\nwe propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core\ngeographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into\nan iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed\ninto three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects\nrelevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that\nchooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in\nprevious rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative\nrefinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further\nrounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction\nquality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable\nrelationships.

We further\nidentify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias,\na fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks.

      "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for\nenhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However,\ncurrent RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently\nretrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be\nresolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk\nretrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information\nsignals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive\nInformation Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that\nintegrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether\nto retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs\na dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer\nand a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these\noutputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically\nimproving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a\ndual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and\nself-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information\nSelection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to\nboth sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance\nefficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy\nthrough contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.\nExperimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS\nreduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)\nwhile still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior\nbaselines on average.",

To address these challenges, we propose a method\nthat leverages llm to dynamically construct user knowledge graphs, thereby\nenhancing the serendipity of recommendation systems. This method comprises a\ntwo stage framework:(1) two-hop interest reasoning, where user static profiles\nand historical behaviors are utilized to dynamically construct user knowledge\ngraphs via llm. Two-hop reasoning, which can enhance the quality and accuracy\nof LLM reasoning results, is then performed on the constructed graphs to\nidentify users' potential interests; and(2) Near-line adaptation, a\ncost-effective approach to deploying the aforementioned models in industrial\nrecommendation systems.

Despite this progress, the current design of how\nLLMs interact with databases exhibits critical limitations in usability,\nsecurity, privilege management, and data transmission efficiency. To resolve\nthese challenges, we introduce BridgeScope, a universal toolkit bridging LLMs\nand databases through three key innovations.

Third, it introduces a proxy mechanism for\nseamless inter-tool data transfer, bypassing LLM transmission bottlenecks. All\nof these designs are database-agnostic and can be transparently integrated with\nexisting agent architectures. We also release an open-source implementation of\nBridgeScope for PostgreSQL.

      "abstract": "Conversational search aims to satisfy users' complex information needs via\nmultiple-turn interactions. The key challenge lies in revealing real users'\nsearch intent from the context-dependent queries. Previous studies achieve\nconversational search by fine-tuning a conversational dense retriever with\nrelevance judgments between pairs of context-dependent queries and documents.\nHowever, this training paradigm encounters data scarcity issues. To this end,\nwe propose ConvMix, a mixed-criteria framework to augment conversational dense\nretrieval, which covers more aspects than existing data augmentation\nframeworks. We design a two-sided relevance judgment augmentation schema in a\nscalable manner via the aid of large language models. Besides, we integrate the\nframework with quality control mechanisms to obtain semantically diverse\nsamples and near-distribution supervisions to combine various annotated data.\nExperimental results on five widely used benchmarks show that the\nconversational dense retriever trained by our ConvMix framework outperforms\nprevious baseline methods, which demonstrates our superior effectiveness.",

However, social interactions have two key\ncharacteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability,\nwhere utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit\nassignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as\nrapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal\nachievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL\nwith single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines\ncoarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards.\nUtterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by\nattributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards\ncapture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking.\nExperiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate\nthat Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17\non Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing\napproaches.

However, their growing openness and\ninteraction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial\nattacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as\ndedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this\nparadigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection,\nand (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised,\nsystem-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents\nfurther raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose\nEvo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that\nenables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than\nrelying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to\nsimultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats,\nensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure.\nFurthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing\nreinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial\ntraining paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS\nperformance under co-evolving threats. Experiments show that Evo-MARL reduces\nattack success rates by up to 22% while boosting accuracy by up to 5% on\nreasoning tasks-demonstrating that safety and utility can be jointly improved.",

Consequently, LLMs can\ngenerate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review\nsystematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual\naccuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset\nlimitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes\nthe need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting\nstrategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of\nthe recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and\nmitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction\ntuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG\nframeworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the\nvalue of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance\nof domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the\nreview underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate\nand explainable but also tailored for domain-specific fact-checking.

We conducted a multi-session user\nstudy with four BLV programmers, where, after an initial tutorial session,\nparticipants independently completed 12 distinct models across two testing\nsessions, achieving results that aligned with their own satisfaction.

      "abstract": "The growing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world\napplications has raised concerns about their potential misuse in generating\nharmful or deceptive content. To address this issue, watermarking techniques\nhave emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages\ninto generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent\nefforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich\ninformation such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the\nfundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure\nreliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token\nsets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated\ncontent. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that\nimproves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects\npreferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a\nlarger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that\nrely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a\nclustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even\nwhen the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and\ndecoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the\nmessage into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically\ndecode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text\nand improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs\ndemonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and\ntext generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines.",

      "abstract": "Long-context large language models (LLMs), such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and\nClaude-Sonnet-4, are increasingly used to empower advanced AI systems,\nincluding retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and autonomous agents.\nIn these systems, an LLM receives an instruction along with a context--often\nconsisting of texts retrieved from a knowledge database or memory--and\ngenerates a response that is contextually grounded by following the\ninstruction. Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset\nof texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the\nLLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including\nperforming post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and\ntrustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made,\nstate-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation\ncost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a\nsingle response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context\ntraceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a\nprompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques\ndesigned to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical\ninsights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for\nAttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and\nefficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods.

To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):\nan asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and\ngenerates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer\nand solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a\nreward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives\na reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of\nground-truth answers.

      "title": "Are We on the Right Way for Assessing Document Retrieval-Augmented Generation?",
      "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) show great promise for complex document understanding, yet their\ndevelopment is critically hampered by inadequate evaluation. Current benchmarks\noften focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with\nincomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect\nreal-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal\nevaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each\ncomponent within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880\npages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4\ndocument types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data\ncontamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence\npages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness.\nOur comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4\nMLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text\nand visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building\nstronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the\nover-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to\nprovide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source\nDouble-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced\ndocument RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new\nbenchmarks on an annual basis.",

When users provide\ninputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation\nhallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their\nself-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench\n(FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty\npremises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises\nand integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth\nassessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1)\nMost models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation\nperformance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for\nerror detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises\ntrigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to\nblindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of\nfaulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models,\nrevealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation\nmodels.

      "abstract": "Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in\nhow users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain\ninsight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated\ncontent are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other\nmemes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called\nMeme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,\nmost existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual\nbackground, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme\nmatching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude\nthe many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of\nautomated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to\ncontemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader\nformulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show\nthat conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise\ncomputation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes\nbut fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the\nsegment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image\nmeasures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a\nprompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for\nmeme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared\nvisual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that\nrequires more sophisticated matching techniques.",

High-level synthesis (HLS), as a pivotal solution,\nautomates hardware designs from high-level abstractions (e.g., C/C++). However,\nit faces significant challenges, particularly in design space exploration and\noptimization. While large language models (LLMs) have shown notable\ncapabilities in code generation, their application to HLS has been limited due\nto the scarcity of (publicly) available HLS code datasets. Hence, research in\nthis domain has primarily focused on techniques such as prompt engineering and\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To overcome this limitation, this paper\nintroduces SAGE-HLS, the first-of-its-kind fine-tuned LLM specifically for HLS\ncode generation. Our method includes three key advancements: (i) We implement\nVerilog-to-C/C++ porting, converting verified and synthesizable Verilog codes\ninto corresponding C, creating a dataset of 16.7K HLS codes; (ii) We implement\na fine-tuning strategy, which is based on instruction prompting to code\ngeneration guided by abstract syntax tree (AST); (iii) We develop a\nsemi-automated evaluation framework using VerilogEval to assess the\nfunctionality of the generated HLS code.

However, the\nintegration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative,\nintroduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination\nproblems. These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse\ndistribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical\nrelationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that\nlead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose\nMultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source\nretrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our\nframework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module\nthat employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical\nrelationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the\nsparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that\nimplements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both\ngraph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable\ninformation nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source\ninconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and\ntwo multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the\nreliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source\nscenarios. \\textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in\nhttps://github.com/wuwenlong123/MultiRAG.",

      "abstract": "The growing scale of evaluation tasks has led to the widespread adoption of\nautomated evaluation using large language models, a paradigm known as\n\"LLMas-a-judge.\" However, improving its alignment with human preferences\nwithout complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. In this work,\nmotivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode\nsemantically and taskrelevant representations that are often more aligned with\nhuman judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a lightweight and\nefficient framework for enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge alignment with human scoring,\nvia internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by\naggregating cross-layer scoretoken logits and computing the expected score from\na softmax-based distribution, with the LLM backbone kept frozen. LAGER fully\nleverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the\nlimitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the\nstandard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman\ncorrelation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the\nbest baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches\nor outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications,\nsuch as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the\neffectiveness of our method.",

However, existing LLM-based AR guidance often lacks rich visual\naugmentations to effectively embed instructions into spatial context for a\nbetter user understanding. We present Guided Reality, a fully automated AR\nsystem that generates embedded and dynamic visual guidance based on\nstep-by-step instructions.

Drawing from a corpus of user manuals, we define five\ncategories of visual guidance and propose an identification strategy based on\nthe current step.

Additionally,\nfour instructors shared insights on how Guided Reality could be integrated into\ntheir training workflows.",

There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but\nthey excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer\nfrom semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic\ncoherence and high scalability.

Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic\ncoherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives.

Current approaches primarily follow\ntwo paradigms:discrete optimization of text prompts through prompt engineering,\nor continuous adaptation via additional trainable parameters.

To address these\nconstraints, we propose EmbedGrad, a novel framework that optimizes text prompt\nembeddings through gradient-based refinement. Our approach uniquely decouples\ntraining from deployment:during optimization,labeled examples guide precise\nembedding adjustments while preserving semantic meaning; during inference, only\noptimized embeddings integrate with user queries. This enables fine-grained\ncalibration impossible in text space, such as enhancing the reasoning\ncapability of prompts like please reason step by step. Comprehensive\nevaluations across mathematical reasoning, sentiment analysis, and causal\njudgment tasks demonstrate EmbedGrad's effectiveness:optimizing this reasoning\nprompt for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B increased accuracy from 14.74\\% to 58.96\\% on\nmathematical problems. Consistent improvements were observed across model\nscales (0.5B-14B) and all tasks, with particularly significant gains for\nsmaller models on complex problems like causal judgment.

However,\ntheir intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to\ninaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with\nhallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is\nparticularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or\nsource code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for\nInterpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors\nin interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact\nfunctional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural\nlanguage) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a\nsystem of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection\nframework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based\ncorrection. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source\nLLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This\nbalance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the\ntrade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results\nacross different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both\ncomputational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving,\nprediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.",

These models\nare typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral\ndrift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.\nHowever, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due\nto its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose\nSmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior\ndata to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen\nconsists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware\nSplit module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically\ncoherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose\nSemantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving\nrepresentative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,\nwe introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior\nrelationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the\nLLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core\nbehavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify\nand remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve\nthe factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.\nExperiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen\nsignificantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior\nprediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by\n85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average.

      "title": "On the Evaluation of Large Language Models in Multilingual Vulnerability Repair",
      "abstract": "Various Deep Learning-based approaches with pre-trained language models have\nbeen proposed for automatically repairing software vulnerabilities. However,\nthese approaches are limited to a specific programming language (C/C++). Recent\nadvances in large language models (LLMs) offer language-agnostic capabilities\nand strong semantic understanding, exhibiting potential to overcome\nmultilingual vulnerability limitations. Although some work has begun to explore\nLLMs' repair performance, their effectiveness is unsatisfactory. To address\nthese limitations, we conducted a large-scale empirical study to investigate\nthe performance of automated vulnerability repair approaches and\nstate-of-the-art LLMs across seven programming languages. Results show GPT-4o,\ninstruction-tuned with few-shot prompting, performs competitively against the\nleading approach, VulMaster. Additionally, the LLM-based approach shows\nsuperior performance in repairing unique vulnerabilities and is more likely to\nrepair the most dangerous vulnerabilities. Instruction-tuned GPT-4o\ndemonstrates strong generalization on vulnerabilities in previously unseen\nlanguage, outperforming existing approaches. Analysis shows Go consistently\nachieves the highest effectiveness across all model types, while C/C++ performs\nthe worst. Based on findings, we discuss the promise of LLM on multilingual\nvulnerability repair and the reasons behind LLM's failed cases. This work takes\nthe first look at repair approaches and LLMs across multiple languages,\nhighlighting the promising future of adopting LLMs for multilingual\nvulnerability repair.",

However, designing\nincentive mechanisms that motivate ASPs to deliver high-quality AIGC services\nremains a challenge, especially in the presence of information asymmetry. In\nthis paper, we address bonus design between a teleoperator and an edge ASP when\nthe teleoperator cannot observe the ASP's private settings and chosen actions\n(diffusion steps). We formulate this as an online learning contract design\nproblem and decompose it into two subproblems: ASP's settings inference and\ncontract derivation.

To shorten this loop we built a hierarchical,\ntool using agent framework that automates molecular optimisation. A Principal\nResearcher defines each objective, a Database agent retrieves target\ninformation, an AI Expert generates de novo scaffolds with a sequence to\nmolecule deep learning model, a Medicinal Chemist edits them while invoking a\ndocking tool, a Ranking agent scores the candidates, and a Scientific Critic\npolices the logic. Each tool call is summarised and stored causing the full\nreasoning path to remain inspectable. The agents communicate through concise\nprovenance records that capture molecular lineage, to build auditable, molecule\ncentered reasoning trajectories and reuse successful transformations via in\ncontext learning. Three cycle research loops were run against AKT1 protein\nusing five large language models. After ranking the models by mean docking\nscore, we ran 20 independent scale ups on the two top performers. We then\ncompared the leading LLMs' binding affinity results across three\nconfigurations, LLM only, single agent, and multi agent. Our results reveal an\narchitectural trade off, the multi agent setting excelled at focused binding\noptimization, improving average predicted binding affinity by 31%. In contrast,\nsingle agent runs generated molecules with superior drug like properties at the\ncost of less potent binding scores. Unguided LLM runs finished fastest, yet\ntheir lack of transparent tool signals left the validity of their reasoning\npaths unverified.

      "abstract": "Human cognition naturally engages with abstract and fluid concepts, whereas\nexisting reasoning models often rely on generating discrete tokens, potentially\nconstraining their expressive capabilities. Recent advancements aim to address\nthis limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft,\nabstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space.\nThis paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by\nexamining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques.\nContrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous\nexploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs\npredominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during\nsubsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different\nreasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding,\nobscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens.\nTo tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce\n\\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the\nGumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness\ncan alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential\nof Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate\nrandomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across\neight reasoning benchmarks.",

The steady growth of studies and\nfindings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to\nsystematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents\nan approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)\ngeneration to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of\nlarge language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts\ninto semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from\nthese sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain\nand ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate\nontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during\nextraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming\n`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity\nfor generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated\nsentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context\nvariable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new\nrelationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge\ngraph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a\ncentralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be\nthe foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.",

To overcome this,\nwe propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error\ngeneration and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language\n(NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently\nambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system\nbehaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data\ndependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and\nhandle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code\ngeneration framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal\nspecifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified\nModeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented\narchitectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating\ndecision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural\nrelationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously\neliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data\nflow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI\nsystematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual\ncode synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained\nmathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with\nLLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and\ndependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load\nassociated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy\nand efficiency.",

Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not\ninterpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in\nneurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We\nfirst identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical\nreasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic\nreasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach\ncomprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,\nperforms symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on\ndomain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on\ndomain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there\nhas not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the\nfollowing question: Which approach is more promising for developing general\nlogical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class\ndomain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses\nthe integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the\nhybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each\napproach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising\nfor developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is\nmore interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of\nexisting LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a\ngeneralizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,\nmodel-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.",

      "abstract": "Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities through structured and multi-step reasoning. While prior research\nhas primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies,\ntheir potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To\nfill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking),\na new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two\nreasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy.\nSpecifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel:\none in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of\nThinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent,\nusing a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both\ncandidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\\%\nin GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases,\nresulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple\nreasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms\nfew-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer\nrobustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to\ntraining-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on\nout-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the\ncalibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes\nconsistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural\nthinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between\nactual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round\nof thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach. Finally, we\ndiscuss current limitations and outline promising directions for future ICL\nresearch in RLLMs.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their\ninability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their\neffectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing\nmemory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for\ndefining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge\nextraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address\nthese foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing\nmemory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core\ninnovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by\nEvent Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for\nautonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically\ncoherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second,\nits Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables\nthe agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined\nheuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path\ntoward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents.\nExtensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that\nNemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its\nadvantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.",

      "abstract": "Repository-level code comprehension and knowledge sharing remain core\nchallenges in software engineering. Large language models (LLMs) have shown\npromise by generating explanations of program structure and logic. However,\nthese approaches still face limitations: First, relevant knowledge is\ndistributed across multiple files within a repository, aka semantic\nfragmentation. Second, retrieval inefficiency and attention saturation degrade\nperformance in RAG pipelines, where long, unaligned contexts overwhelm\nattention. Third, repository specific training data is scarce and often\noutdated. Finally, proprietary LLMs hinder industrial adoption due to privacy\nand deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose Key-Augmented\nNeural Triggers (KANT), a novel approach that embeds knowledge anchors into\nboth training and inference. Unlike prior methods, KANT enables internal access\nto repository specific knowledge, reducing fragmentation and grounding\ninference in localized context. Moreover, we synthesize specialized data\ndirectly from code. At inference, knowledge anchors replace verbose context,\nreducing token overhead and latency while supporting efficient, on premise\ndeployment. We evaluate KANT via: a qualitative human evaluation of the\nsynthesized dataset's intent coverage and quality across five dimensions;\ncompare against SOTA baselines across five qualitative dimensions and inference\nspeed; and replication across different LLMs to assess generalizability.\nResults show that the synthetic training data aligned with information-seeking\nneeds. KANT achieved over 60% preference from human annotators and a LocalStack\nexpert (preferring 79% of cases). Also, KANT reduced inference latency by up to\n85% across all models. Overall, it is well-suited for scalable, low-latency,\non-premise deployments, providing a strong foundation for code comprehension.",

While increasing the number of sampled\nframes is a common strategy, we observe a \"less is more\" phenomenon where\nexcessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution.\nConcurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective,\nstill yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To\naddress these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel\npost-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes.

However, most existing approaches, e.g., Best-of-N and\nSelf-Consistency rely on a single agent interacting with a reward model\n(SA-SR), constrained by limited capabilities of a single test-time scaling\n(STTS) paradigm. On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that\ncollective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent\nsystems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first\nstep towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the\ndifferent interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three\nprimary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent\nto multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model\n(MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance.\nBased on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively\nleverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced\ninference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent\nCollaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination\nof LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model\ncollaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a\ncurated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to\nselect the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking\n(PRR) metric.

Prior research has often probed gender bias using\nexplicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion\nand short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit\nforms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work,\nwe investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in\npsychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of\nnarrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories\ncontaining short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or\nsix) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related\nstory endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story\nchanges in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1)\nWhile models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned\nprompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes\nmitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same\ngender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias\nand female ones alleviating it.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama have shown remarkable\ncapabilities in a variety of software engineering tasks. Despite the\nadvancements, their practical deployment faces challenges, including high\nfinancial costs, long response time, and varying performance, especially when\nhandling a large number of queries (jobs). Existing optimization strategies for\ndeploying LLMs for diverse tasks focus on static scheduling, which requires\nextensive training data for performance prediction, increasing the\ncomputational costs and limiting the applicability and flexibility. In this\npaper, we propose the SmartLLMs Scheduler (SLS), a dynamic and cost-effective\nscheduling solution. The key idea is to learn LLMs' performance on diverse\ntasks and incorporate their real-time feedback to update strategies\nperiodically. Specifically, SLS incorporates three key components, including an\nAdaptive Cache Manager, a Performance-Cost Optimized Scheduler, and a Dynamic\nUpdate Manager. The Cache Manager stores the outputs of previously processed\nqueries and employs an adaptive strategy to reduce redundant computations and\nminimize response times. For queries not found in the cache, the Scheduler\ndynamically allocates them to the most suitable LLM based on the predicted\nperformance and cost from models that take both query-specific and LLM-specific\nfeatures as input. The Update Manager continuously refines the cache and\nscheduling strategies based on real-time feedback from the assigned queries to\nenhance decision-making and adapt to evolving task characteristics. To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of SLS, we conduct extensive experiments on two LLM-based\nsoftware engineering tasks, including log parsing and code generation. The\nresults show that SLS significantly outperforms the baseline methods, achieving\nan average performance improvement of 198.82% and an average processing time\nreduction of 63.28%.",

      "abstract": "Prior clinical psychology research shows that Western individuals with\ndepression tend to report psychological symptoms, while Eastern individuals\nreport somatic ones. We test whether Large Language Models (LLMs), which are\nincreasingly used in mental health, reproduce these cultural patterns by\nprompting them with Western or Eastern personas. Results show that LLMs largely\nfail to replicate the patterns when prompted in English, though prompting in\nmajor Eastern languages (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, and Hindi) improves alignment\nin several configurations. Our analysis pinpoints two key reasons for this\nfailure: the models' low sensitivity to cultural personas and a strong,\nculturally invariant symptom hierarchy that overrides cultural cues. These\nfindings reveal that while prompt language is important, current\ngeneral-purpose LLMs lack the robust, culture-aware capabilities essential for\nsafe and effective mental health applications.",

However, existing\nembodied planning benchmarks frequently feature short-horizon tasks and\ncoarse-grained action primitives. To address this challenge, we introduce\nCookBench, a benchmark for long-horizon planning in complex cooking scenarios.\nBy leveraging a high-fidelity simulation environment built upon the powerful\nUnity game engine, we define frontier AI challenges in a complex, realistic\nenvironment. The core task in CookBench is designed as a two-stage process.\nFirst, in Intention Recognition, an agent needs to accurately parse a user's\ncomplex intent. Second, in Embodied Interaction, the agent should execute the\nidentified cooking goal through a long-horizon, fine-grained sequence of\nphysical actions. Unlike existing embodied planning benchmarks, we refine the\naction granularity to a spatial level that considers crucial operational\ninformation while abstracting away low-level robotic control. Besides, We\nprovide a comprehensive toolset that encapsulates the simulator. Its unified\nAPI supports both macro-level operations, such as placing orders and purchasing\ningredients, and a rich set of fine-grained embodied actions for physical\ninteraction, enabling researchers to focus on high-level planning and\ndecision-making. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of\nstate-of-the-art, closed-source Large Language Model and Vision-Language Model,\nrevealing their major shortcomings and challenges posed by complex,\nlong-horizon tasks.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating\ncode with programming languages and could potentially aid in system model\ndevelopment, no benchmarks currently exist for evaluating their ability to\ngenerate system models with specific description languages. We present\nSysMBench, which comprises 151 human-curated scenarios spanning a wide range of\npopular domains and varying difficulty levels. Each scenario mainly comprises a\nnatural language requirements description, a system model expressed in a\nspecific model description language, and a visualized system model diagram. The\nrequirements description is fed as user input to the LLM, the system model with\ndescription language is used to verify if the generated system model conforms\nto the requirements, and the visualized diagram serves to support manual\nvalidation. We introduce SysMEval, a semantic-aware evaluation metric to\nevaluate the quality of generated system models. We evaluate 17 popular LLMs on\nthis task with three traditional metrics and SysMEval, from directly prompting\nto three commonly used enhancement strategies. Our in-depth evaluation shows\nthat LLMs perform poorly on SysMBench, with the highest BLEU of 4% and\nSysMEval-F1 of 62%.

In this paper, we\nreveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear\nin completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting\ngradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be\nessential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded\ncompletions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward\nunlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading\nlearning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective\npolicy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative\nTrajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens\nappearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards,\nprotects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To\nfurther prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy\nexceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence\nregularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training,\nwhile still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance,\nvalidated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the expansion of neural network models and training data has\ndriven remarkable progress in deep learning, particularly in computer vision\nand natural language processing. This advancement is underpinned by the concept\nof Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training\ndata enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed\nbreakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and\nadvanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its\npotential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for\ndecision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by\nsystematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,\nand training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data\nefficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the\nrelationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we\ninvestigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,\nensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which\ncollectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational\nchallenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of\ndistributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary\ntraining on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these\nstrategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in\nadvancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future\nresearch. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with\ncomputational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging\nscaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot\ncontrol, autonomous driving and LLM training.",

      "abstract": "Mathematical geometric reasoning is essential for scientific discovery and\neducational development, requiring precise logic and rigorous formal\nverification. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\nhave improved reasoning tasks, existing models typically struggle with formal\ngeometric reasoning, particularly when dynamically constructing and verifying\nauxiliary geometric elements. To address these challenges, we introduce\nGeoint-R1, a multimodal reasoning framework designed to generate formally\nverifiable geometric solutions from textual descriptions and visual diagrams.\nGeoint-R1 uniquely integrates auxiliary elements construction, formal reasoning\nrepresented via Lean4, and interactive visualization. To systematically\nevaluate and advance formal geometric reasoning, we propose the Geoint\nbenchmark, comprising 1,885 rigorously annotated geometry problems across\ndiverse topics such as plane, spatial, and solid geometry. Each problem\nincludes structured textual annotations, precise Lean4 code for auxiliary\nconstructions, and detailed solution steps verified by experts. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that Geoint-R1 significantly surpasses existing\nmultimodal and math-specific reasoning models, particularly on challenging\nproblems requiring explicit auxiliary element constructions.",

      "title": "CoTox: Chain-of-Thought-Based Molecular Toxicity Reasoning and Prediction",
      "abstract": "Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent\nmachine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their\nreliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their\napplicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities\ndriven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual\ndata, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.\nTo address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM\nwith chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox\ncombines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)\nterms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step\nreasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional\nmachine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance\nacross various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we\nfind that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier\nfor LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and\nimproves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug\ndevelopment, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and\nincorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This\napproach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with\nphysiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the\npotential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support\nearly-stage drug safety assessment.

      "abstract": "Robots operating in human-centric or hazardous environments must proactively\nanticipate and mitigate dangers beyond basic obstacle detection. Traditional\nnavigation systems often depend on static maps, which struggle to account for\ndynamic risks, such as a person emerging from a suddenly opening door. As a\nresult, these systems tend to be reactive rather than anticipatory when\nhandling dynamic hazards. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language\nmodels and vision-language models (VLMs) create new opportunities for proactive\nhazard avoidance. In this work, we propose a zero-shot language-as-cost mapping\nframework that leverages VLMs to interpret visual scenes, assess potential\ndynamic risks, and assign risk-aware navigation costs preemptively, enabling\nrobots to anticipate hazards before they materialize. By integrating this\nlanguage-based cost map with a geometric obstacle map, the robot not only\nidentifies existing obstacles but also anticipates and proactively plans around\npotential hazards arising from environmental dynamics.

However, this approach\nsuffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the\nloss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic\nthat are less appealing to human readers.\n  In this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to\nimprove the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core\ncomponents of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model\ncomprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most\nimportant memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory\nstorage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To\nincorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle\nframework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain\nfactors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates\nthe similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by\nbuilding a knowledge graph and integrating new node content.

Radar technologies offer a promising sensing\nmodality for material recognition task. When combined with deep learning, radar\ntechnologies have demonstrated strong potential in identifying the material of\nvarious objects.

This raises an important question: Can we leverage the powerful\nreasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to directly infer material\ncomposition from raw radar signals? Answering this question is non-trivial due\nto the inherent redundancy of radar signals and the fact that pre-trained LLMs\nhave no prior exposure to raw radar data during training. To address this, we\nintroduce LLMaterial, the first study to investigate the feasibility of using\nLLM to identify materials directly from radar signals. First, we introduce a\nphysics-informed signal processing pipeline that distills high-redundancy radar\nraw data into a set of compact intermediate parameters that encapsulate the\nmaterial's intrinsic characteristics. Second, we adopt a retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) strategy to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge,\nenabling it to interpret and reason over the extracted intermediate parameters.\nLeveraging this integration, the LLM is empowered to perform step-by-step\nreasoning on the condensed radar features, achieving open-set material\nrecognition directly from raw radar signals.

However, this integration brings new\nsecurity vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external\ndatabase can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior\nwork has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely\nheavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval\nand generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box\nscenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack\non the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and\nblack-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an\nattacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token\nlevel, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation.\nExtensive experiments on open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that TPARAG\nconsistently outperforms previous approaches in retrieval-stage and end-to-end\nattack effectiveness. These results further reveal critical vulnerabilities in\nRAG pipelines and offer new insights into improving their robustness.",

      "abstract": "Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are\ncritical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the\ninherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with\nvarious cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on\npersonalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper\nproposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three\ndirectional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo,\nMono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative\nreciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented\nby three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning\ncontents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of\ncommunication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided\ninto base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that\ngenerative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest\naccuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity.

      "abstract": "In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm in large language\nmodels (LLMs), enabling them to perform novel tasks by conditioning on a few\nexamples embedded in the prompt. Yet, the highly nonlinear behavior of ICL for\nNLP tasks remains poorly understood. To shed light on its underlying\nmechanisms, this paper investigates whether LLMs can solve ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) under the ICL setting. We formulate standard ODE\nproblems and their solutions as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on\nthese tasks. Experiments on two types of ODEs show that GPT-2 can effectively\nlearn a meta-ODE algorithm, with convergence behavior comparable to, or better\nthan, the Euler method, and achieve exponential accuracy gains with increasing\nnumbers of demonstrations. Moreover, the model generalizes to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) problems, demonstrating robust extrapolation\ncapabilities. These empirical findings provide new insights into the mechanisms\nof ICL in NLP and its potential for solving nonlinear numerical problems.",

To address this issue, we propose a\nnew scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes\nscene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities.

We quantitatively benchmark system performance,\ncode complexity, and development speed against prior, human-coded\narchitectures, finding that AI-generated code can deliver functionally complete\ncommand-and-control stacks at orders-of-magnitude faster development cycles,\nthough with identifiable current limitations related to specific model context\nwindow and reasoning depth. Our analysis uncovers the practical boundaries of\nAI-driven robot control code generation at current model scales, as well as\nemergent strengths and failure modes in AI-generated robotics code. This work\nsets a precedent for the autonomous creation of robot control systems and, more\nbroadly, suggests a new paradigm for robotics engineeringone in which future\nrobots may be largely co-designed, developed, and verified by artificial\nintelligence.

Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined\ntasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems\nfrom international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to\nformalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and\nchallenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these\nshortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered\naround the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target\nnumber from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss\nhow this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal\nbenchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows\nfor an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is\ncomputationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich\nenough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive\ntheoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and\ndemonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public\nbenchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on\ninstances generated using our procedure.

To address this, we propose the Coherent Multimodal\nReasoning Framework (CMRF), a novel approach that enhances LVLMs' common sense\nreasoning capabilities through an iterative, self-evaluating inference\nmechanism. CMRF mimics human problem-solving by decomposing complex queries,\ngenerating step-by-step inferences, and self-correcting errors. Our framework\nintegrates three key modules: a Reasoning Decomposition Unit (RDU) for breaking\ndown problems into sub-questions, a Contextual Inference Engine (CIE) for\ncontextual inference, and a Coherence Assessment Module (CAM) for evaluating\nlogical consistency and confidence. Coupled with an Adaptive Iterative\nRefinement strategy, CMRF systematically refines its reasoning paths. Built\nupon LLaVA-1.6-34B and trained on a novel Multimodal Daily Activity Reasoning\n(MDAR) dataset, CMRF achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source\nLVLMs on challenging benchmarks like VCR, A-OKVQA, and DailyLife-MRC.

For example, when interacting with a\nchatbot, malicious users can input specially crafted prompts to cause the LLM\nto generate undesirable content or perform a completely different task from its\nintended purpose. Existing mitigations for such attacks typically rely on\nhardening the LLM's system prompt or using a content classifier trained to\ndetect undesirable content or off-topic conversations. However, these\nprobabilistic approaches are relatively easy to bypass due to the very large\nspace of possible inputs and undesirable outputs. In this paper, we present and\nevaluate Highlight & Summarize (H&S), a new design pattern for\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that prevents these attacks by\ndesign. The core idea is to perform the same task as a standard RAG pipeline\n(i.e., to provide natural language answers to questions, based on relevant\nsources) without ever revealing the user's question to the generative LLM. This\nis achieved by splitting the pipeline into two components: a highlighter, which\ntakes the user's question and extracts relevant passages (\"highlights\") from\nthe retrieved documents, and a summarizer, which takes the highlighted passages\nand summarizes them into a cohesive answer. We describe several possible\ninstantiations of H&S and evaluate their generated responses in terms of\ncorrectness, relevance, and response quality. Surprisingly, when using an\nLLM-based highlighter, the majority of H&S responses are judged to be better\nthan those of a standard RAG pipeline.",

      "abstract": "Foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly\nused as core components of AI agents in complex, large-scale workflows across\nfederated and heterogeneous environments. In agentic workflows, autonomous\nagents plan tasks, interact with humans and peers, and shape scientific\noutcomes. This makes transparency, traceability, reproducibility, and\nreliability essential. However, AI-based agents can hallucinate or reason\nincorrectly, and their decisions may propagate errors through the workflow,\nespecially when one agent's output feeds into another's input. Therefore,\nfine-grained provenance is essential to link agent decisions, their end-to-end\ncontext, and downstream impacts. While provenance techniques have long\nsupported reproducibility and workflow data understanding, they fail to capture\nand relate agent-centric metadata (prompts, responses, and decisions) with the\nrest of the workflow. In this paper, we introduce PROV-AGENT, a provenance\nmodel that extends W3C PROV and leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to\nintegrate agent interactions into end-to-end workflow provenance. Our\ncontributions include: (1) a provenance model tailored for agentic workflows,\n(2) a near real-time, open-source system for capturing agentic provenance, and\n(3) a cross-facility evaluation spanning edge, cloud, and HPC environments,\ndemonstrating support for critical provenance queries and agent reliability\nanalysis.",

The existing AI development landscape\nfalls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that\nnatively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that\nabstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While\npowerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,\nthey not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also\nsteerability.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled\nricher perceptual grounding for code policy generation in embodied agents.\nHowever, most existing systems lack effective mechanisms to adaptively monitor\npolicy execution and repair codes during task completion. In this work, we\nintroduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that\nsystematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual\nmonitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for\nembodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system\nfirst decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program\ngrounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed\nin simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected\ncheckpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure\nreasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events\nwith VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and\nrepairs programs. This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting\nprogram synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that\nHyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of\nrobot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating\nmultimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines.",

We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under\ncertain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even\ninteriority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance,\nbut in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological\ncomplexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical\nnotion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct\nmeaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the\nhuman-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,\nanimism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its\nunique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the\nphenomenological withdrawal of such projections.

The model is trained on four 2D cortical surface\nprojection maps derived from neonatal MRI scans. By employing distinct prompts\nfor training and inference, our approach enables the MLLM to handle a\nregression task during training and generate clinically relevant explanations\nduring inference. The fine-tuned model achieves a low prediction error with a\n95 percent confidence interval of 0.78 to 1.52 weeks, while producing\ninterpretable outputs grounded in developmental features, marking a significant\nstep toward transparent and trustworthy AI systems in perinatal neuroscience.",

      "title": "Transportation Cyber Incident Awareness through Generative AI-Based Incident Analysis and Retrieval-Augmented Question-Answering Systems",
      "abstract": "Technological advancements have revolutionized numerous industries, including\ntransportation. While digitalization, automation, and connectivity have\nenhanced safety and efficiency, they have also introduced new vulnerabilities.\nWith 95% of data breaches attributed to human error, promoting cybersecurity\nawareness in transportation is increasingly critical. Despite numerous\ncyberattacks on transportation systems worldwide, comprehensive and centralized\nrecords of these incidents remain scarce. To address this gap and enhance cyber\nawareness, this paper presents a large language model (LLM) based approach to\nextract and organize transportation related cyber incidents from publicly\navailable datasets. A key contribution of this work is the use of generative AI\nto transform unstructured, heterogeneous cyber incident data into structured\nformats. Incidents were sourced from the Center for Strategic & International\nStudies (CSIS) List of Significant Cyber Incidents, the University of Maryland\nCyber Events Database (UMCED), the European Repository of Cyber Incidents\n(EuRepoC), the Maritime Cyber Attack Database (MCAD), and the U.S. DOT\nTransportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency (TraCR) Examples of Cyber Attacks\nin Transportation (2018 to 2022). These were classified by a fine tuned LLM\ninto five transportation modes: aviation, maritime, rail, road, and multimodal,\nforming a transportation specific cyber incident database. Another key\ncontribution of this work is the development of a Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration question answering system, designed to enhance accessibility and\npractical use by enabling users to query the curated database for specific\ndetails on transportation related cyber incidents. By leveraging LLMs for both\ndata extraction and user interaction, this study contributes a novel,\naccessible tool for improving cybersecurity awareness in the transportation\nsector.",

In parallel, AI hardware is\nscaling up, with Huawei's CloudMatrix384 SuperPod offering hundreds of GB/s\nhigh-speed interconnects. Running large MoE models on SuperPod-scale hardware\nbrings new challenges. It requires new execution models, scalable scheduling,\nefficient expert load balancing, and elimination of single points of failure.\nThis paper presents xDeepServe, Huawei Cloud's LLM serving system designed for\nSuperPod-scale infrastructure. At its core is Transformerless, a disaggregated\narchitecture that decomposes transformer models into modular units--attention,\nfeedforward, and MoE--executed independently on NPUs connected via high-speed\nfabric. We implement this design in two forms: disaggregated prefill-decode and\ndisaggregated MoE-attention. This fully disaggregated setup enables independent\nscaling of compute and memory without sacrificing performance. To support this\narchitecture, we propose XCCL, a communication library that leverages\nCloudMatrix384's global shared memory to implement efficient point-to-point and\nall-to-all primitives.

Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nhas brought new promise to analog design automation. However, existing work\nremains in its early stages, and holistic joint optimization for practical\nend-to-end solutions remains largely unexplored. We propose AnalogCoder-Pro, a\nunified multimodal LLM-based framework that integrates generative capabilities\nand optimization techniques to jointly explore circuit topologies and optimize\ndevice sizing, automatically generating performance-specific, fully sized\nschematic netlists. AnalogCoder-Pro employs rejection sampling for fine-tuning\nLLMs on high-quality synthesized circuit data and introduces a multimodal\ndiagnosis and repair workflow based on functional specifications and waveform\nimages. By leveraging LLMs to interpret generated circuit netlists,\nAnalogCoder-Pro automates the extraction of critical design parameters and the\nformulation of parameter spaces, establishing an end-to-end workflow for\nsimultaneous topology generation and device sizing optimization.

We first develop a comprehensive,\nmulti-faceted evaluation framework that includes: (i) a formal conformity\nscore, (ii) automated quality assessment using LLMs, (iii) human evaluation,\nand (iv) classification-based probing tasks. Using this framework, we evaluate\nthe generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15\nopen-source models across four families, under five prompting strategies:\nzero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-tuned, and chain-of-thought.\nFinally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation\nframework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as\na reward signal, we fine-tune three lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal\nconformity. Our findings offer new insights into the generative strengths and\nlimitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally\nconstrained literary texts.",

To address these issues, we propose the Reinforced\nReasoning Model for Relevance Assessment (R3A), which introduces a decomposed\nreasoning framework over queries and candidate documents before scoring.

      "abstract": "While open source communities attract diverse contributors globally, few\nrepositories provide essential documentation in languages other than English.\nLarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\nsoftware engineering tasks and translations across domains. However, little is\nknown about LLM capabilities in translating open-source technical\ndocumentation, which mixes natural language, code, URLs, and markdown\nformatting. To understand the need and potential for LLMs in technical\ndocumentation translation, we evaluated community translation activity and\nEnglish-to-German translations of 50 README files using OpenAI's ChatGPT 4 and\nAnthropic's Claude. We found scarce translation activity, mostly in larger\nrepositories and community-driven in nature. LLM performance comparison\nsuggests they can provide accurate translations. However, analysis revealed\nfidelity challenges: both models struggled to preserve structural components\n(e.g., hyperlinks) and exhibited formatting inconsistencies. These findings\nhighlight both promise and challenges of LLM-assisted documentation\ninternationalization. As a first step toward translation-aware continuous\nintegration pipelines, we introduce TRIFID, an early-stage translation fidelity\nscoring framework that automatically checks how well translations preserve\ncode, links, and formatting. Our efforts provide a foundation for automated\nLLM-driven support for creating and maintaining open source documentation.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in industrial domains, offering\nnew opportunities for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). These models\nhelp address challenges such as high development costs, long deployment cycles,\nand limited generalizability. However, despite the growing synergy between PHM\nand LLMs, existing evaluation methodologies often fall short in structural\ncompleteness, dimensional comprehensiveness, and evaluation granularity. This\nhampers the in-depth integration of LLMs into the PHM domain. To address these\nlimitations, this study proposes PHM-Bench, a novel three-dimensional\nevaluation framework for PHM-oriented large models. Grounded in the triadic\nstructure of fundamental capability, core task, and entire lifecycle, PHM-Bench\nis tailored to the unique demands of PHM system engineering. It defines\nmulti-level evaluation metrics spanning knowledge comprehension, algorithmic\ngeneration, and task optimization. These metrics align with typical PHM tasks,\nincluding condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, RUL prediction, and\nmaintenance decision-making. Utilizing both curated case sets and publicly\navailable industrial datasets, our study enables multi-dimensional evaluation\nof general-purpose and domain-specific models across diverse PHM tasks.\nPHM-Bench establishes a methodological foundation for large-scale assessment of\nLLMs in PHM and offers a critical benchmark to guide the transition from\ngeneral-purpose to PHM-specialized models.",

      "abstract": "Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual\ncognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current\nmethods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the\nmulti-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces\nfundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal\nresolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and\nthe lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI\nvideo reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor\nmodule explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments.\n(2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual\ndescriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging\nhigh-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from\nexisting datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation\nstudies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic\ncaptioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP\nsimilarity by 71.8%.

A\ntotal of 67 Italian-language student essays, written as part of a university\npsychology course, were evaluated using a four-criterion rubric (Pertinence,\nCoherence, Originality, Feasibility). Each model scored all essays across three\nprompt replications to assess intra-model stability. Human-LLM agreement was\nconsistently low and non-significant (Quadratic Weighted Kappa), and\nwithin-model reliability across replications was similarly weak (median\nKendall's W < 0.30). Systematic scoring divergences emerged, including a\ntendency to inflate Coherence and inconsistent handling of context-dependent\ndimensions. Inter-model agreement analysis revealed moderate convergence for\nCoherence and Originality, but negligible concordance for Pertinence and\nFeasibility.

      "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal\ncomprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe\nobject hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to\nlinguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large\nlanguage models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon\nLLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,\ngenerating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an\nin-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a\npreviously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information\nbut also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality\nbias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both\nvisual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of\nuser-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet\neffective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we\nintervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,\nbalancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.\nFurthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's\noverreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our\nattention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence\nof modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates\nhallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting\nits generalizability and efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted\nlong-context processing. However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size\nposes critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache\ncompression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads\nin Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different\nfunctionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens\nand thus degrades the performance of LLMs.\n  To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in\nGQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first\nidentify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of\nretrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of\nretrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding\nsemantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important\ntokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze\nthe cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a\nlayer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe proposed CompressKV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches\nunder various memory budgets on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks.\nOur code is publicly available at: https://github.com/TUDa-HWAI/CompressKV.git.",

      "title": "Beyond Manually Designed Pruning Policies with Second-Level Performance Prediction: A Pruning Framework for LLMs",
      "abstract": "Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering\nlower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing\nnon-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g.,\nlayer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt\nto scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical\nbottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further\nlimits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning\npolicies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning\nFramework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design\ndependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports\nreal-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable\nto static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and\nreal-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can\nevaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative\noptimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can\ngenerate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to\n33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods,\noutperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor\nachieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction\nerror < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1\nminute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52\nseconds), achieving over 64 times speedup.

While previous studies have proposed this\nissue, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the internal\nrepresentations of these stances and the mechanisms that lead to unintended\ncross-topic generalization. In this paper, we systematically explore the\ninternal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon from a neuron-level perspective\nand how to mitigate the cross-topic generalization of political fine-tuning.\nFirstly, we propose Political Neuron Localization through Activation\nContrasting (PNLAC) to identify two distinct types of political neurons:\ngeneral political neurons, which govern stance across multiple political\ntopics, and topic-specific neurons} that affect the model's political stance on\nindividual topics. We find the existence of these political neuron types across\nfour models and datasets through activation patching experiments. Leveraging\nthese insights, we introduce InhibitFT, an inhibition-based fine-tuning method,\neffectively mitigating the cross-topic stance generalization. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the robustness of identified neuron types across various\nmodels and datasets, and show that InhibitFT significantly reduces the\ncross-topic stance generalization by 20% on average, while preserving\ntopic-specific performance.

Compared to traditional\nreinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers\nthree significant advantages.

Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is\nlightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling\nlarge-scale edge deployment.

Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily\nfocused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although\nthe new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x\nspeedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this\ncapability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose\nMicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix\nmultiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the\nBlackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of\nMXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a\nfavorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we\nintroduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where\nlower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.\nOur algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve\naccuracy while maintaining compute efficiency.

      "title": "LaMPE: Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding for Adaptive Long-context Scaling Without Training",
      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) experience significant performance degradation\nwhen the input exceeds the pretraining context window, primarily due to the\nout-of-distribution (OOD) behavior of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Recent\nstudies mitigate this problem by remapping OOD positions into the\nin-distribution range with fixed mapping strategies, ignoring the dynamic\nrelationship between input length and the model's effective context window. To\nthis end, we propose Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding (LaMPE), a\ntraining-free method that fully utilizes the model's effective context window\nfor adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs. Motivated by the left-skewed\nfrequency distribution of relative positions, LaMPE establishes a dynamic\nrelationship between mapping length and input length through a parametric\nscaled sigmoid function to adaptively allocate positional capacity across\nvarying input lengths. Meanwhile, LaMPE devises a novel multi-grained attention\nmechanism that strategically allocates positional resolution across different\nsequence regions to capture both fine-grained locality and long-range\ndependencies. Our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of\nRoPE-based LLMs without training. Extensive experiments on three representative\nLLMs across five mainstream long-context benchmarks demonstrate that LaMPE\nachieves significant performance improvements compared to existing length\nextrapolation methods. The code will be released at\nhttps://github.com/scar-on/LaMPE.",

      "title": "CAPO: Towards Enhancing LLM Reasoning through Verifiable Generative Credit Assignment",
      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the\nreasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary\nfeedback, helping to mitigate reward hacking. However, current RLVR methods\ntypically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to\nevery token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,\nmaking it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or\nfailure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.\nMethods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often\nyield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other\nhand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments\nfor each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision\nlabels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning\n(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method\nCredit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response\nrollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf,\ngeneral-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to\ngenerate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable\ntoken-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned\nidentical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment\nin an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of\nCAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated\ncritiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen\nmodels and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms\nsupervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six\nchallenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks.",

However, autonomously\nbuilding computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the\ncomplexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the\nneed for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we\nintroduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework\nthat transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly\ninto optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given\nonly raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge\noutputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training\nvirtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules:\nTask Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature\nretrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop\noptimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated\ngeneration of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts\nwith differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to\ncollaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus.\nWe demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction,\nusing six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and\ncytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently\noutperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods.

A core challenge in RLVR involves managing the exchange between entropy\nand performance of policies. Despite the importance of this exchange, a\nfine-grained understanding of when and how this exchange operates most\neffectively remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic\nempirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across\ndifferent levels of granularity. Specifically, we first divide the training\nprocess into two distinct stages based on entropy dynamics, i.e., rising stage\nand plateau stage, and then systematically investigate how this mechanism\nvaries across stage-level, instance-level, and token-level granularitiess. Our\nanalysis reveals that, in the rising stage, entropy reduction in negative\nsamples facilitates the learning of effective reasoning patterns, which in turn\ndrives rapid performance gains. Moreover, in the plateau stage, learning\nefficiency strongly correlates with high-entropy tokens present in\nlow-perplexity samples and those located at the end of sequences. Motivated by\nthese findings, we propose two methods that dynamically adjust the reward\nsignal using perplexity and positional information to focus RL updates on\ntokens that exhibit high learning potential, achieving improvements compared to\nthe baseline methods on various LLMs.",

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant\npotential across various tasks, integrating them into ASR remains an open\nchallenge. By decomposing the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator of words (or\ntokens) given the acoustic signal, we derive an iterative procedure that\nfacilitates a novel integration of the AM and LLM, while maintaining their\nseparability. This approach enables each component to be independently trained\nand improved using its own data, thereby maximizing the system's performance by\nleveraging the strengths of both models without requiring joint optimization.\nWe illustrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to three language\nmodels: N-gram, GCNN, and TransformerLM across multiple datasets spanning\nvarious speech styles, including ALLSSTAR, WSJ0, and TED-LIUM 3. Our\nexperiments involved two acoustic models (wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT) and three\nLLMs (GPT-2, LLaMA 2, and Falcon).

      "abstract": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant\npotential in constructing passage retrieval datasets. However, existing methods\nstill face limitations in expressing cross-doc query needs and controlling\nannotation quality. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nbidirectional generation pipeline, which aims to generate 3-level hierarchical\nqueries for both intra-doc and cross-doc scenarios and mine additional\nrelevance labels on top of direct mapping annotation. The pipeline introduces\ntwo query generation methods: bottom-up from single-doc text and top-down from\nmulti-doc titles. The bottom-up method uses LLMs to disassemble and generate\nstructured queries at both sentence-level and passage-level simultaneously from\nintra-doc passages. The top-down approach incorporates three key financial\nelements--industry, topic, and time--to divide report titles into clusters and\nprompts LLMs to generate topic-level queries from each cluster. For relevance\nannotation, our pipeline not only relies on direct mapping annotation from the\ngeneration relationship but also implements an indirect positives mining method\nto enrich the relevant query-passage pairs. Using this pipeline, we constructed\na Financial Passage Retrieval Generated dataset (FinCPRG) from almost 1.3k\nChinese financial research reports, which includes hierarchical queries and\nrich relevance labels. Through evaluations of mined relevance labels,\nbenchmarking and training experiments, we assessed the quality of FinCPRG and\nvalidated its effectiveness as a passage retrieval dataset for both training\nand benchmarking.",

Although existing sparse attention\nmechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as\nstatic patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask\nsparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes\ncontent-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key\ninnovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from\nvalue representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical\ninformation adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention\ncomputation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This\ndual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational\ncomplexity of important information while retaining complete information,\nachieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational\nefficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive\nexperiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head\nattention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native\nsparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.\nMoreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also\ndemonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.\nCrucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly\noutperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the\nchallenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its\ncapability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability\neffectively.",

Among\nthem, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional\nperformance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of\nR1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models\nenhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by\nincorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection\nthrough reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of\nthese models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged.

To this\nend, various efficient reasoning methods have been proposed, aiming to reduce\nthe length of reasoning paths without compromising model performance and\nreasoning capability. By reviewing the current research advancements in the\nfield of efficient reasoning methods systematically, we categorize existing\nworks into two main directions based on the lens of single-model optimization\nversus model collaboration: (1) Efficient Reasoning with Single Model, which\nfocuses on improving the reasoning efficiency of individual models; and (2)\nEfficient Reasoning with Model Collaboration, which explores optimizing\nreasoning paths through collaboration among multiple models.

However,\nthis tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack\nsurface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names,\ndescriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify\nthis as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be\npreferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or\naccess to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we\npropose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning\nframework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically\nvalid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates\nseamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the\nagent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic,\nsimulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate\nconsistently high attack success rates (81\\%-95\\%) and significant privacy\nleakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack\nremains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured\ntool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic\nvulnerabilities in current agent architectures.

Current fingerprinting approaches face a fundamental trade-off:\nintrinsic methods require full parameter access, while backdoor-based\ntechniques employ statistically anomalous triggers easily detected and filtered\nby adversaries. To address these limitations, we introduce FPEdit, a novel\nknowledge-editing framework that injects semantically coherent natural language\nfingerprints by modifying a sparse subset of model weights.

Extensive experiments show that FPEdit achieves $95$-$100\\%$\nfingerprint retention under both full-parameter fine-tuning and\nparameter-efficient adaptation, while preserving performance on 24 downstream\nbenchmarks. Moreover, FPEdit remains robust under quantization, pruning, and\nstochastic decoding, and can embed 10 fingerprint pairs into LLaMA2-7B in under\n10 minutes using less than 32 GB of GPU memory, a $70\\%$ reduction in resource\nrequirements compared to existing techniques.

We find that\nsimple opinion statements reliably induce sycophancy, whereas user expertise\nframing has a negligible impact. Through logit-lens analysis and causal\nactivation patching, we identify a two-stage emergence of sycophancy: (1) a\nlate-layer output preference shift and (2) deeper representational divergence.\nWe also verify that user authority fails to influence behavior because models\ndo not encode it internally. In addition, we examine how grammatical\nperspective affects sycophantic behavior, finding that first-person prompts\n(``I believe...'') consistently induce higher sycophancy rates than\nthird-person framings (``They believe...'') by creating stronger\nrepresentational perturbations in deeper layers.

These trajectories contain\nrich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving\nproblems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they\nignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of\nsearch spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To\naddress these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that\nenables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach\nrevisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:\nrevision, recombination, and refinement.

We curate DriftCaps, a targeted diagnostic benchmark of safe and\nunsafe prompts designed to quantify alignment drift and safety degradation.\nEmpirical evaluations show that AGL mitigates alignment drift by up to 50% on\nsafety-critical benchmarks without degrading downstream task performance.\nComprehensive ablation confirms that each component contributes distinctly to\npreserving latent safety behaviors. Finally, we derive and validate a scaling\nlaw for catastrophic forgetting, revealing that AGL flattens post-finetuning\nloss escalation while preserving adaptation dynamics. AGL is a structurally\ngrounded refinement of LoRA, ensuring alignment preservation with minimal\ntrade-offs. To encourage further exploration and development, we open-source\nour implementation.",

      "abstract": "Coordinating multiple large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks\ncollaboratively poses a fundamental trade-off between the computation costs and\ncollective performance compared with individual model. We introduce a novel,\ngame-theoretically grounded reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the\nMulti-Agent Cooperation Sequential Public Goods Game (MAC-SPGG), to\nsystematically incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles. In MAC-SPGG, LLM\nagents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs\nto condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward,\neffortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium\n(SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its\nsequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a\nstreamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining\nstrategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under\nrealistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles\noutperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other\ncooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale\nmodels across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks.

      "abstract": "Functional object arrangement (FORM) is the task of arranging objects to\nfulfill a function, e.g., \"set up a dining table for two\". One key challenge\nhere is that the instructions for FORM are often under-specified and do not\nexplicitly specify the desired object goal poses. This paper presents SetItUp,\na neuro-symbolic framework that learns to specify the goal poses of objects\nfrom a few training examples and a structured natural-language task\nspecification. SetItUp uses a grounding graph, which is composed of abstract\nspatial relations among objects (e.g., left-of), as its intermediate\nrepresentation. This decomposes the FORM problem into two stages: (i)\npredicting this graph among objects and (ii) predicting object poses given the\ngrounding graph. For (i), SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to\ninduce Python programs from a task specification and a few training examples.\nThis program can be executed to generate grounding graphs in novel scenarios.\nFor (ii), SetItUp pre-trains a collection of diffusion models to capture\nprimitive spatial relations and online composes these models to predict object\nposes based on the grounding graph. We evaluated SetItUp on a dataset spanning\nthree distinct task families: arranging tableware on a dining table, organizing\nitems on a bookshelf, and laying out furniture in a bedroom. Experiments show\nthat SetItUp outperforms existing models in generating functional, physically\nfeasible, and aesthetically pleasing object arrangements.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often\nexhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when\nexposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased\njailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,\nlittle is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these\nfailures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe\ncompletions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central\nto our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic\ninconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved\ntraining documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary\ninterventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses\ncompletions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a\ncontrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,\nand (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam\nexpansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce\nalignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)\nwhile preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and\nimproved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift\nlikelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and\nlength to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first\nscalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating\nalignment failures at source.

Furthermore, we\nintroduce a new prompting strategy to mitigate the position bias of LLM\nrecommendation models called Ranking via Iterative SElection (RISE).

      "abstract": "Social media, such as Twitter, provides opportunities for caregivers of\ndementia patients to share their experiences and seek support for a variety of\nreasons. Availability of this information online also paves the way for the\ndevelopment of internet-based interventions in their support. However, for this\npurpose, tweets written by caregivers of dementia patients must first be\nidentified. This paper demonstrates our system for the SMM4H 2025 shared task\n3, which focuses on detecting tweets posted by individuals who have a family\nmember with dementia. The task is outlined as a binary classification problem,\ndifferentiating between tweets that mention dementia in the context of a family\nmember and those that do not. Our solution to this problem explores large\nlanguage models (LLMs) with various prompting methods. Our results show that a\nsimple zero-shot prompt on a fine-tuned model yielded the best results.

      "title": "Prefill-Decode Aggregation or Disaggregation? Unifying Both for Goodput-Optimized LLM Serving",
      "abstract": "An ongoing debate considers whether prefill-decode (PD) aggregation or\ndisaggregation is superior for serving large language models (LLMs). This has\ndriven optimizations for both approaches, each showing distinct advantages.\nThis paper compares PD aggregation and disaggregation, showing that each excels\nunder different service-level objectives (SLOs): aggregation is optimal for\ntight time-to-first-token (TTFT) and relaxed time-per-output-token (TPOT),\nwhile disaggregation excels for strict TPOT and relaxed TTFT. However, under\nbalanced TTFT and TPOT SLOs, neither approach delivers optimal goodput.\n  This paper proposes TaiChi, an LLM serving system that unifies PD\ndisaggregation and aggregation for optimal goodput under any combination of\nTTFT and TPOT SLOs. TaiChi uses a unified disaggregation-aggregation\narchitecture with differentiated-capability GPU instances: prefill-heavy (fast\nprefill, high-interference decode) and decode-heavy (low-interference decode,\nslow prefill). Three configurable sliders control the ratio between these\ninstances and their chunk sizes. TaiChi adapts to various SLO regimes by\nadjusting sliders. When TTFT constraints are tight, TaiChi resembles a PD\naggregation configuration; when TPOT dominates, it adapts toward PD\ndisaggregation. Crucially, under balanced SLOs, TaiChi enables a hybrid mode\nfor superior goodput. The key innovation behind this hybrid mode is latency\nshifting: selectively reallocating GPU resources from requests that meet SLOs\nto those at risk of violation, maximizing the number of SLO-satisfied requests.\nThis fine-grained latency shifting is orchestrated by two scheduling\nmechanisms: flowing decode scheduling to control TPOTs and length-aware prefill\nscheduling to manage TTFTs, which jointly optimize request assignment. Our\nexperiments show TaiChi improves goodput by up to 77% over state-of-the-art\nsystems under balanced TTFT and TPOT SLOs.",

In this work, we introduce a unified framework that seamlessly\nintegrates these diverse modalities, leveraging all relevant available\ninformation through a two-stage architecture for clinical risk prediction. In\nthe first stage, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) extracts crucial,\ntask-relevant information from clinical notes, which is enhanced by graph-based\nretrieval of external domain knowledge from sources such as a medical corpus\nlike PubMed, grounding the LLM's understanding. The second stage combines both\nunstructured representations and features derived from the structured data to\ngenerate the final predictions. This approach supports a wide range of clinical\ntasks. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness on 30-day readmission and\nin-hospital mortality prediction. Experimental results show that our framework\nachieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$,\nrespectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with\npositive rates ranging from approximately $4\\%$ to $13\\%$.

A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling\ninference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used\nto reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods\nintroduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large\nnumbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs\ncan be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection\nof suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We\nintroduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that\nthe scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of\nfinal output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on\nintermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both\ntheoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases\nexponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong\ncorrelation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On\nmath reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\\times$-9$\\times$\nreduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance.

However, scaling these methods to general-purpose\nservice robots remains challenging: (1) classical planning algorithms generally\nrequire a detailed and consistent specification of the environment, which is\nnot always readily available; and (2) existing frameworks mainly focus on\nisolated planning tasks, whereas robots are often meant to serve in long-term\ncontinuous deployments, and therefore must maintain a dynamic memory of the\nenvironment which can be updated with multi-modal inputs and extracted as\nplanning knowledge for future tasks. To address these two issues, this paper\nintroduces L3M+P (Lifelong LLM+P), a framework that uses an external knowledge\ngraph as a representation of the world state. The graph can be updated from\nmultiple sources of information, including sensory input and natural language\ninteractions with humans.

      "abstract": "Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on\nmassive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes\navailable. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual\npre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining\nfrom scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution\nshifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this\npaper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this\ndistribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay\nand gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the\nLlama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100\nbillion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and\ngradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This\nconclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and\ndiversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose\nan efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues\nexperience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible\ncompute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay\nrates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a\nmore valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more\ncompute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of\nreplaying old examples.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, research on transforming natural language into graph query\nlanguage (NL2GQL) has been increasing. Most existing methods focus on\nsingle-turn transformation from NL to GQL. In practical applications, user\ninteractions with graph databases are typically multi-turn, dynamic, and\ncontext-dependent. While single-turn methods can handle straightforward\nqueries, more complex scenarios often require users to iteratively adjust their\nqueries, investigate the connections between entities, or request additional\ndetails across multiple dialogue turns. Research focused on single-turn\nconversion fails to effectively address multi-turn dialogues and complex\ncontext dependencies. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn\nNL2GQL datasets further hinders the progress of this field. To address this\nchallenge, we propose an automated method for constructing multi-turn NL2GQL\ndatasets based on Large Language Models (LLMs) , and apply this method to\ndevelop the MTGQL dataset, which is constructed from a financial market graph\ndatabase and will be publicly released for future research. Moreover, we\npropose three types of baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of\nmulti-turn NL2GQL translation, thereby laying a solid foundation for future\nresearch.",

A rigorous filtering step is\nemployed to maintain high dialogue quality. We validate ProKG Dial on a medical\nknowledge graph by evaluating the generated dialogues in terms of diversity,\nsemantic coherence, and entity coverage.

      "abstract": "Testing network protocol implementations is critical for ensuring the\nreliability, security, and interoperability of distributed systems. Faults in\nprotocol behavior can lead to vulnerabilities and system failures, especially\nin real-time and mission-critical applications. A common approach to protocol\ntesting involves constructing Markovian models that capture the state\ntransitions and expected behaviors of the protocol. However, building such\nmodels typically requires significant domain expertise and manual effort,\nmaking the process time-consuming and difficult to scale across diverse\nprotocols and implementations.\n  We propose a novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to\nautomatically generate sequences for testing network protocol implementations.\nOur approach begins by defining the full set of possible protocol states, from\nwhich the LLM selects a subset to model the target implementation. Using this\nstate-based model, we prompt the LLM to generate code that produces sequences\nof states. This program serves as a protocol-specific sequences generator. The\nsequences generator then generates test inputs to call the protocol\nimplementation under various conditions. We evaluated our approach on three\nwidely used network protocol implementations and successfully identified 12\npreviously unknown vulnerabilities.

Existing methods based on large language\nmodels fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate\nthe closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes\na multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first\ntime integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search\nmechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and\nhypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating\nscientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an\ninitial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior\nbeliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It\nthen employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature\nevidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes'\ntheorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information\nentropy $H = - \\sum {{p_i}\\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the\niterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and\nconfidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world\nresearch question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12\noptimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves\nby 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the\nframework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases\nsignificantly by 0.92.

Current research shows that using large language\nmodels (LLMs) to fine-tune a task-specific preference extractor yields\nexcellent results in terms of accuracy and generalization. However, the primary\nchallenge stems from the inherent difficulty in obtaining high-quality labeled\nmulti-turn dialogue data. Accurately tracking user preference transitions\nacross turns not only demands intensive domain expertise and contextual\nconsistency maintenance for annotators (termed \\textbf{``Annotating\nDisaster''}) but also complicates model training due to error propagation in\nsequential dependency learning. Inspired by the observation that multi-turn\npreference extraction can be decomposed into iterative executions of one-turn\nextraction processes. We propose a novel dialogue data generation framework\nnamed \\textbf{IterChat}. First, we construct a new data format that categorizes\nthe dialogue data into attributed historical preferences and one-turn\ndialogues. This reduces the probability of annotation errors and improves\nannotation efficiency. Then, to generate a high-quality and diverse dialogue\ndataset, we adopt GPT4 to pre-define the preference slots in the target\npreference extractor task and then randomly sample the subset of the slots and\ntheir corresponding schema values to create the dialogue datasets. Experimental\nresults indicate that fine-tuning or only few-shot prompting with the new\ndialogue format yields superior performance compared to the original multi-turn\ndialogues.

      "abstract": "Data representation remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning,\nparticularly when adapting sequence-based architectures like Transformers and\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) for structured tabular data. Existing methods\noften fail to cohesively encode the mix of numerical and categorical features\nor preserve the inherent structure of tables. This paper introduces a novel,\nhybrid tokenisation methodology designed to convert tabular data into a\nunified, sequential format suitable for LLM training. Our approach combines\npredefined fixed tokens to represent structural elements and low-cardinality\ncategorical features, with a learned subword vocabulary using Byte-Pair\nEncoding (BPE) for high-cardinality and continuous values. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of this technique by applying it to a large-scale NetFlow dataset\n(CIDDS-001), preparing a corpus for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)\nfoundation model. The evaluation shows that our method is highly efficient,\nprocessing over 31 million network flows in under five hours and achieving a\nsignificant data compression ratio of 6.18:1. This process resulted in a\ncomputationally manageable corpus of over one billion tokens, establishing a\nviable and generalisable pathway for training foundation models on structured\ndata.",

      "abstract": "Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance\nthe reasoning quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by assigning fine-grained\nscores to intermediate reasoning steps within a solution trajectory. However,\nexisting PRMs predominantly adopt a unidirectional left-to-right (L2R)\nevaluation paradigm, which limits their ability to leverage global context,\nmaking it challenging to verify the consistency of earlier steps based on later\nones. In light of these challenges, we propose a novel bidirectional evaluation\nparadigm, named Bidirectional Process Reward Model (BiPRM). BiPRM seamlessly\nincorporates a parallel right-to-left (R2L) evaluation stream alongside the\nconventional L2R flow, enabling later reasoning steps to help assess earlier\nones in real time. Notably, the built-in R2L evaluation is implemented solely\nthrough prompt modifications that reverse the original reasoning trajectory,\nwithout any additional parameters or inference latency introduced. This ensures\nBiPRM remains both efficient and broadly compatible with existing PRM studies.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks using\nsamples generated by three different policy models. Our method, BiPRM, is\nevaluated across three backbones and three distinct PRM objectives. Across all\nsettings, BiPRM consistently outperforms unidirectional baselines, achieving up\nto a 31.9% improvement in stepwise reward evaluation. Generally, our results\nhighlight BiPRM's effectiveness, robustness, and general applicability,\noffering a promising new direction for process-based reward modeling.",

However, existing GraphRAG methods\nlargely ignore the temporal dynamics of knowledge, leading to issues such as\ntemporal ambiguity, time-insensitive retrieval, and semantic redundancy. To\novercome these limitations, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (T-GRAG), a dynamic,\ntemporally-aware RAG framework that models the evolution of knowledge over\ntime. T-GRAG consists of five key components: (1) a Temporal Knowledge Graph\nGenerator that creates time-stamped, evolving graph structures; (2) a Temporal\nQuery Decomposition mechanism that breaks complex temporal queries into\nmanageable sub-queries; (3) a Three-layer Interactive Retriever that\nprogressively filters and refines retrieval across temporal subgraphs; (4) a\nSource Text Extractor to mitigate noise; and (5) a LLM-based Generator that\nsynthesizes contextually and temporally accurate responses. We also introduce\nTime-LongQA, a novel benchmark dataset based on real-world corporate annual\nreports, designed to test temporal reasoning across evolving knowledge.\nExtensive experiments show that T-GRAG significantly outperforms prior RAG and\nGraphRAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response relevance under\ntemporal constraints, highlighting the necessity of modeling knowledge\nevolution for robust long-text question answering.

To address these issues, we design two\ncompensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices\nbetween LLMs of different scales.

In reality, humans hold\ndynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact\nwith an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual\npreferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure\nalignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated\ninteraction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In\neach interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and\nexpresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user\nrequest and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can\ninfer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that\nsatisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary\nLLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from\nmulti-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant\nto a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall.

      "abstract": "Audio Captioning (AC) plays a pivotal role in enhancing audio-text\ncross-modal understanding during the pretraining and finetuning of multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs). To further strengthen this alignment, recent\nworks have proposed Audio Difference Captioning (ADC), which takes multiple\naudio inputs and encourages the model to describe their differences, thereby\npromoting fine-grained audio discrimination. However, despite its effectiveness\nin enabling difference-telling and detailed discrimination, ADC introduces a\nnotable semantic gap between the input audios-often rich in diverse sound\nevents-and the relatively brief, difference-focused output captions. This\ndeviation from AC-style descriptions leads to a mismatch with the pretraining\nobjective, resulting in catastrophic forgetting during finetuning. To mitigate\nthis issue, we propose Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC), a comparably\nchallenging but gentler alternative that encourages the model to capture the\nshared semantics across audio clips rather than emphasizing their detailed\ndifferences. Experimental results demonstrate that ACC not only effectively\nenhances audio-text understanding on primary captioning benchmarks but also\nbetter preserves general capabilities across diverse speech and music-related\ndownstream tasks, such as vocal sound classification (VSC), speech emotion\nrecognition (SER), musical instrument classification (MIC), and music genre\nclassification (MGC), compared to ADC.

Regression diagnostics\ndemonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on\nrecognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and\nidentifiable landmarks.

To address these challenges, we\npropose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot\nframework tailored for digital pathology.

In particular, most\nof them rely on large amounts of clean data to weaken the backdoor mapping but\ngenerally struggle with residual trigger effects, resulting in persistently\nhigh attack success rates (ASR). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel\nBackdoor defense method based on Directional mapping module and adversarial\nKnowledge Distillation (BeDKD), which balances the trade-off between defense\neffectiveness and model performance using a small amount of clean and poisoned\ndata. We first introduce a directional mapping module to identify poisoned\ndata, which destroys clean mapping while keeping backdoor mapping on a small\nset of flipped clean data. Then, the adversarial knowledge distillation is\ndesigned to reinforce clean mapping and suppress backdoor mapping through a\ncycle iteration mechanism between trust and punish distillations using clean\nand identified poisoned data. We conduct experiments to mitigate mainstream\nattacks on three datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that BeDKD\nsurpasses the state-of-the-art defenses and reduces the ASR by 98% without\nsignificantly reducing the CACC.

      "title": "Getting out of the Big-Muddy: Escalation of Commitment in LLMs",
      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous\ndecision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are\ntrained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that\nsystematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,\nwhere decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to\nprior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique\nchallenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear\nwhether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering\nconditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment\ntask across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,\nmulti-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500\ntrials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In\nindividual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate\nstrong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.\nHowever, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,\nN = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates\n(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal\nescalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and\npersonal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of\nescalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).\nThese findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social\nand organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant\nimplications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised\noperations where such conditions may emerge naturally.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through\npreference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the\nunderlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data\nquality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce\nRefine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as\nboth a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing\niterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate\nrefinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every\niteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human\nannotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response\nand judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer.\nThis process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the\nrefinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of\nincreasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public\ndatasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and\nconversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on\nRefine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of\ncomparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4.\nAdditionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval\n2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces\nhigh-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a study of using large language models (LLMs) in\nmodifying existing code. While LLMs for generating code have been widely\nstudied, their role in code modification remains less understood. Although\n\"prompting\" serves as the primary interface for developers to communicate\nintents to LLMs, constructing effective prompts for code modification\nintroduces challenges different from generation. Prior work suggests that\nnatural language summaries may help scaffold this process, yet such approaches\nhave been validated primarily in narrow domains like SQL rewriting. This study\ninvestigates two prompting strategies for LLM-assisted code modification:\nDirect Instruction Prompting, where developers describe changes explicitly in\nfree-form language, and Summary-Mediated Prompting, where changes are made by\nediting the generated summaries of the code. We conducted an exploratory study\nwith 15 developers who completed modification tasks using both techniques\nacross multiple scenarios. Our findings suggest that developers followed an\niterative workflow: understanding the code, localizing the edit, and validating\noutputs through execution or semantic reasoning. Each prompting strategy\npresented trade-offs: direct instruction prompting was more flexible and easier\nto specify, while summary-mediated prompting supported comprehension, prompt\nscaffolding, and control. Developers' choice of strategy was shaped by task\ngoals and context, including urgency, maintainability, learning intent, and\ncode familiarity. These findings highlight the need for more usable prompt\ninteractions, including adjustable summary granularity, reliable summary-code\ntraceability, and consistency in generated summaries.",

However, improving both personalization and interpretability\nremains a challenge, particularly in scenarios involving limited user feedback\nor heterogeneous item attributes. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid\nrecommendation framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to address these limitations. LLMs are first used\nto enrich user and item representations by generating semantically meaningful\nprofiles based on metadata such as titles, genres, and overviews. These\nenriched embeddings serve as initial node features in a user and movie\nbipartite graph, which is processed using a GAT based collaborative filtering\nmodel. To enhance ranking accuracy, we introduce a hybrid loss function that\ncombines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), cosine similarity, and robust\nnegative sampling. Post-processing involves reranking the GAT-generated\nrecommendations using the LLM, which also generates natural-language\njustifications to improve transparency. We evaluated our model on benchmark\ndatasets, including MovieLens 100k and 1M, where it consistently outperforms\nstrong baselines.

Our experiments demonstrate that this\nactivation overhead, scaling with sequence length and hidden dimension,\nprevents current SVD compression techniques from achieving any reduction in\npeak inference memory, thereby limiting their viability for real-world,\non-device deployments.\n  We introduce FlashSVD, a novel, end-to-end rank-aware streaming inference\nframework specifically designed for SVD-compressed large language models.\nFlashSVD can be seamlessly integrated with any model that employs SVD-based\nmethods for parameter reduction.

These\nmodels provide an alternative to traditional autoregressive approaches by\nframing text generation as an iterative denoising process. However, applying\ndiffusion models to structured domains such as source code remains a\nsignificant challenge. Programming languages differ from natural language in\nthat they follow strict syntactic and semantic rules, with hierarchical\norganization that must be preserved for correctness. Standard token-level\ncorruption techniques used during training often ignore this structure, which\nmay hinder the model's ability to learn meaningful representations of code. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a syntax-aware diffusion framework that\nincorporates structural priors from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) into the\ndenoising process. Instead of masking individual tokens at random, we\nselectively corrupt syntactically meaningful code spans derived from AST\nsubtrees. This enables the model to reconstruct programs in a way that respects\ngrammatical boundaries and captures long-range dependencies. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that syntax-aware corruption significantly improves\nsyntactic correctness, reconstruction accuracy, and generalization to unseen\ncode patterns.

      "title": "Think Broad, Act Narrow: CWE Identification with Multi-Agent Large Language Models",
      "abstract": "Machine learning and Large language models (LLMs) for vulnerability detection\nhas received significant attention in recent years. Unfortunately,\nstate-of-the-art techniques show that LLMs are unsuccessful in even\ndistinguishing the vulnerable function from its benign counterpart, due to\nthree main problems: Vulnerability detection requires deep analysis, which LLMs\noften struggle with when making a one-shot prediction. Existing techniques\ntypically perform function-level analysis, whereas effective vulnerability\ndetection requires contextual information beyond the function scope. The focus\non binary classification can result in identifying a vulnerability but\nassociating it with the wrong security weaknesses (CWE), which may mislead\ndevelopers. We propose a novel multi-agent LLM approach to address the\nchallenges of identifying CWEs. This approach consists of three steps: (1) a\nteam of LLM agents performs an exhaustive search for potential CWEs in the\nfunction under review, (2) another team of agents identifies relevant external\ncontext to support or refute each candidate CWE, and (3) a final agent makes\ninformed acceptance or rejection decisions for each CWE based on the gathered\ncontext. A preliminary evaluation of our approach shows promising results. In\nthe PrimeVul dataset, Step 1 correctly identifies the appropriate CWE in 40.9\\%\nof the studied vulnerable functions. We further evaluated the full pipeline on\nten synthetic programs and found that incorporating context information\nsignificantly reduced false positives from 6 to 9 CWEs to just 1 to 2, while\nstill correctly identifying the true CWE in 9 out of 10 cases.",

      "abstract": "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) plays a pivotal role in adapting Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to specialized domains such as medical reasoning. However,\nexisting SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant\nand low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and\nsuboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this\nproblem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and\nreasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility\nreflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence\nalone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but\nlack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly\ncomplex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this\nobservation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence\nQuadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence\nquadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient\ninfluence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data.\nFurthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected\nsubsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is\nmore aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and\nevidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning\npatterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate\nthat DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match\nfull-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms the\nbaseline, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over\nbrute-force scaling.

However, industrial platforms deploying multiple\nLLMs face a critical challenge: prompts optimized for one LLM often fail with\nothers, requiring expensive model-specific prompt engineering. This cross-model\nprompt engineering bottleneck severely limits the practical deployment of\nmulti-LLM optimization systems in production environments. To address this, we\nintroduce Meta-Prompted Code Optimization (MPCO), a framework that\nautomatically generates high-quality, task-specific prompts across diverse LLMs\nwhile maintaining industrial efficiency requirements. MPCO leverages\nmeta-prompting to dynamically synthesize context-aware optimization prompts by\nintegrating project metadata, task requirements, and LLM-specific contexts, and\nit seamlessly deploys on the ARTEMIS industrial platform for automated\nvalidation and scaling.\n  Our comprehensive evaluation on five real-world codebases with 366 hours of\nruntime benchmarking demonstrates MPCO's effectiveness: it achieves overall\nperformance improvements up to 19.06% with the best statistical rank across all\nsystems compared to baseline methods. Analysis shows that 96% of the\ntop-performing optimizations stem from meaningful edits. Through systematic\nablation studies and meta-prompter sensitivity analysis, we identify that\ncomprehensive context integration is essential for effective meta-prompting,\nand that all three major LLMs can serve effectively as meta-prompters,\nproviding actionable insights for industrial practitioners.",

We identify three interacting variants through\nwhich LLM Pollution threatens the validity and integrity of online behavioural\nresearch. First, Partial LLM Mediation occurs when participants make selective\nuse of LLMs for specific aspects of a task, such as translation or wording\nsupport, leading researchers to (mis)interpret LLM-shaped outputs as human\nones. Second, Full LLM Delegation arises when agentic LLMs complete studies\nwith little to no human oversight, undermining the central premise of\nhuman-subject research at a more foundational level. Third, LLM Spillover\nsignifies human participants altering their behaviour as they begin to\nanticipate LLM presence in online studies, even when none are involved. While\nPartial Mediation and Full Delegation form a continuum of increasing\nautomation, LLM Spillover reflects second-order reactivity effects. Together,\nthese variants interact and generate cascading distortions that compromise\nsample authenticity, introduce biases that are difficult to detect post hoc,\nand ultimately undermine the epistemic grounding of online research on human\ncognition and behaviour. Crucially, the threat of LLM Pollution is already\nco-evolving with advances in generative AI, creating an escalating\nmethodological arms race. To address this, we propose a multi-layered response\nspanning researcher practices, platform accountability, and community efforts.\nAs the challenge evolves, coordinated adaptation will be essential to safeguard\nmethodological integrity and preserve the validity of online behavioural\nresearch.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted as research\nassistants, particularly for literature review and reference recommendation,\nyet little is known about whether they introduce demographic bias into citation\nworkflows. This study systematically investigates gender bias in LLM-driven\nreference selection using controlled experiments with pseudonymous author\nnames. We evaluate several LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude Sonnet, and Claude\nHaiku) by varying gender composition within candidate reference pools and\nanalyzing selection patterns across fields. Our results reveal two forms of\nbias: a persistent preference for male-authored references and a majority-group\nbias that favors whichever gender is more prevalent in the candidate pool.\nThese biases are amplified in larger candidate pools and only modestly\nattenuated by prompt-based mitigation strategies. Field-level analysis\nindicates that bias magnitude varies across scientific domains, with social\nsciences showing the least bias. Our findings indicate that LLMs can reinforce\nor exacerbate existing gender imbalances in scholarly recognition. Effective\nmitigation strategies are needed to avoid perpetuating existing gender\ndisparities in scientific citation practices before integrating LLMs into\nhigh-stakes academic workflows.",

To address these\nlimitations, we propose Kronos, a unified, scalable pre-training framework\ntailored to financial K-line modeling. Kronos introduces a specialized\ntokenizer that discretizes continuous market information into token sequences,\npreserving both price dynamics and trade activity patterns. We pre-train Kronos\nusing an autoregressive objective on a massive, multi-market corpus of over 12\nbillion K-line records from 45 global exchanges, enabling it to learn nuanced\ntemporal and cross-asset representations. Kronos excels in a zero-shot setting\nacross a diverse set of financial tasks. On benchmark datasets, Kronos boosts\nprice series forecasting RankIC by 93% over the leading TSFM and 87% over the\nbest non-pre-trained baseline. It also achieves a 9% lower MAE in volatility\nforecasting and a 22% improvement in generative fidelity for synthetic K-line\nsequences. These results establish Kronos as a robust, versatile foundation\nmodel for end-to-end financial time series analysis.

      "abstract": "Code clone detection is a critical task in software engineering, aimed at\nidentifying duplicated or similar code fragments within or across software\nsystems. Traditional methods often fail to capture functional equivalence,\nparticularly for semantic clones (Type 4), where code fragments implement\nidentical functionality despite differing syntactic structures. Recent advances\nin large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding code\nsemantics. However, directly applying LLMs to code clone detection yields\nsuboptimal results due to their sensitivity to syntactic differences. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines\nLLM-based screening with execution-based validation for detecting semantic\nclones in Python programs. In the first stage, an LLM evaluates code pairs to\nfilter out obvious non-clones based on semantic analysis. For pairs not\nidentified as clones, the second stage employs an execution-based validation\napproach, utilizing LLM-generated test inputs to assess functional equivalence\nthrough cross-execution validation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates\nsignificant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score compared to direct\nLLM-based detection, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in identifying\nsemantic clones.

      "abstract": "Security issues are becoming increasingly significant with the rapid\nevolution of Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs). As NFTs are traded as digital assets,\nthey have emerged as prime targets for cyber attackers. In the development of\nNFT smart contracts, there may exist undiscovered defects that could lead to\nsubstantial financial losses if exploited. To tackle this issue, this paper\npresents a framework called NATLM(NFT Assistant LLM), designed to detect\npotential defects in NFT smart contracts. The framework effectively identifies\nfour common types of vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts: ERC-721\nReentrancy, Public Burn, Risky Mutable Proxy, and Unlimited Minting. Relying\nexclusively on large language models (LLMs) for defect detection can lead to a\nhigh false-positive rate. To enhance detection performance, NATLM integrates\nstatic analysis with LLMs, specifically Gemini Pro 1.5. Initially, NATLM\nemploys static analysis to extract structural, syntactic, and execution flow\ninformation from the code, represented through Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and\nControl Flow Graphs (CFG). These extracted features are then combined with\nvectors of known defect examples to create a matrix for input into the\nknowledge base. Subsequently, the feature vectors and code vectors of the\nanalyzed contract are compared with the contents of the knowledge base.\nFinally, the LLM performs deep semantic analysis to enhance detection\ncapabilities, providing a more comprehensive and accurate identification of\npotential security issues. Experimental results indicate that NATLM analyzed\n8,672 collected NFT smart contracts, achieving an overall precision of 87.72%,\na recall of 89.58%, and an F1 score of 88.94%. The results outperform other\nbaseline experiments, successfully identifying four common types of defects.",

      "title": "How Far Are LLMs from Symbolic Planners? An NLP-Based Perspective",
      "abstract": "The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nbeen a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take\nunstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI\nplanning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as\nplanners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated\nactions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with\nLLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various\nplanning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In\nthis paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing\n(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery\npipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along\nwith three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the\nLLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.\nThis pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context\nof AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid\nplans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during\nplan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the\nplans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and\nreliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of\nthe plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated\nplans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and\nincreases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.",

      "abstract": "Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide\nimage (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology\nslides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL\npipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class\ndescriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely\non large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use\nfixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token\ncapacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the\nencoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs\nmay lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to\nsuboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we\npropose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A\ngrounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated\npathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial\ncontext) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text\nencoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt,\ncapturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment\nwith visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows\nimproved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results\ncomparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer\ndatasets.",

To\naddress this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)\nframework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.\nThe key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning\nprocess by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with\nstronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.\nSpecifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or\nlocal knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we\nemploy Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of\nreasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the\nincorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire\nthe capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long\ncontexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly\nimproves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts\nin long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.",

      "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative\ncapabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW)\ncontent, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts\nhave introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the\ninput, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets\nand apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this\nresults not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality,\nbut also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements\nof real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a\ngated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised\nsoft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of\ntraining on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into\nsemantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an\nefficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal\nsoft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the\ndiffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we\nintroduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength\nbased on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with\nprompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving\nbenign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and\nT2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%),\nwhile preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates\nstrong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability\nacross diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial\nattacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.",

In this\npaper, we present TestWeaver, a novel LLM-based approach that integrates\nlightweight program analysis to guide test generation more effectively.\nTestWeaver introduces three key innovations: (1) it reduces hallucinations and\nimproves focus by supplying the LLM with the backward slice from the target\nline instead of full program context; (2) it identifies and incorporates close\ntest cases - those that share control-flow similarities with the path to the\ntarget line - to provide execution context within the LLM's context window; and\n(3) it enhances LLM's reasoning with execution in-line annotations that encode\nvariable states as comments along executed paths. By equipping LLMs with these\ntargeted and contextualized inputs, TestWeaver improves coverage-guided test\ngeneration and mitigates redundant explorations.

In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime\ntraces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present\nAgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph\nintermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations\n(e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system.\nAgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that\nreconstructs the agent's working traces as graph-based intermediate\nrepresentations with control flow and data flow described within; (2) a\nproperty registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools\n& data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over\nthe intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured\nprograms, AgentArmor enables program analysis over sensitive data flow, trust\nboundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo\nbenchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can achieve 95.75% of TPR, with\nonly 3.66% of FPR.

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in solving mathematical problems, yet\ntheir performance is often limited by the availability of high-quality, diverse\ntraining data. Existing methods focus on augmenting datasets through rephrasing\nor difficulty progression but overlook the specific failure modes of LLMs. This\nresults in synthetic questions that the model can already solve, providing\nminimal performance gains. To address this, we propose WarriorMath, a\ndefect-aware framework for mathematical problem solving that integrates both\ntargeted data synthesis and progressive training. In the synthesis stage, we\nemploy multiple expert LLMs in a collaborative process to generate, critique,\nand refine problems. Questions that base LLMs fail to solve are identified and\niteratively improved through expert-level feedback, producing high-quality,\ndefect-aware training data. In the training stage, we introduce a progressive\nlearning framework that iteratively fine-tunes the model using increasingly\nchallenging data tailored to its weaknesses. Experiments on six mathematical\nbenchmarks show that WarriorMath outperforms strong baselines by 12.57% on\naverage, setting a new state-of-the-art. Our results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of a defect-aware, multi-expert framework for improving\nmathematical ability.",

Existing web benchmarks often\nfocus on simplistic interactions, such as form submissions or e-commerce\ntransactions, and often do not require diverse tool-using capabilities required\nfor web based data science. Conversely, traditional data science benchmarks\ntypically concentrate on static, often textually bound datasets and do not\nassess end-to-end workflows that encompass data acquisition, cleaning,\nanalysis, and insight generation. In response, we introduce WebDS, the first\nend-to-end web-based data science benchmark.

For instance, Browser Use, which accomplishes 80% of tasks on Web\nVoyager, successfully completes only 15% of tasks in WebDS, which our analysis\nsuggests is due to new failure modes like poor information grounding,\nrepetitive behavior and shortcut-taking that agents performing WebDS' tasks\ndisplay.

      "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of large language models , code generation has\nbecome a key benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities. However, existing\nbenchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing\nhigh-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk\nof data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based\nevaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation\nframework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code\ngeneration tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates\nperformance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on\nimportance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted\nAutoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks\nto estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation,\nwe introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations\nacross the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that\nsupports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources,\noffering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination\nassessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points\nacross 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks. Our framework achieves an\naverage absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with\nbest- and worst-case errors of 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively. It also generalizes\nwell to other metrics, attaining average absolute errors of 2.15% for pass@1.\nThese results demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability of BIS, which\ncan significantly reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in\ncode-related tasks.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across\ndiverse applications. However, enforcing content restrictions remains a\nsignificant challenge due to their expansive output space. One aspect of\ncontent restriction is preventing LLMs from generating harmful content via\nmodel alignment approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Yet, the need\nfor content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change\nrapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of\nharmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical\ndue to the high computational, data, and storage demands. Motivated by this\nneed, we propose a new task called \\textit{Adaptive Content Restriction}\n(AdaCoRe), which focuses on lightweight strategies -- methods without model\nfine-tuning -- to prevent deployed LLMs from generating restricted terms for\nspecific use cases. We propose the first method for AdaCoRe, named\n\\textit{Suffix Optimization (SOP)}, which appends a short, optimized suffix to\nany prompt to a) prevent a target LLM from generating a set of restricted\nterms, while b) preserving the output quality. To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches,\nincluding our SOP, we create a new \\textit{Content Restriction Benchmark}\n(CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8\ncarefully selected categories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SOP on\nCoReBench, which outperforms the system-level baselines such as system suffix\nby 15\\%, 17\\%, 10\\%, 9\\%, and 6\\% on average restriction rates for Gemma2-2B,\nMistral-7B, Vicuna-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3.1-8B, respectively.

      "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language\nModel (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to\nproduce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT\nreasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate\ninferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT\nreasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore\nfurther. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and\ninvestigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from\nin-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning\npaths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is\nfundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the\ntraining data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning\nvia three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,\nwe design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs\nfrom scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution\nconditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that\nvanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a\ndeeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the\nongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.",

      "abstract": "Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving\nemotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are\ninconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark\ndesigned to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of\nthree subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or\nall modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER\nreveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on\naudio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual\nmodality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient\nframework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two\nmodules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism\nthat reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention\nreallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen\nbackbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it\nmitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent\nsamples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities.\nExperiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our\nCA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nparticularly under modality conflict conditions.",

      "abstract": "Current large language model post-training optimizes a risk-neutral objective\nthat maximizes expected reward, yet evaluation relies heavily on risk-seeking\nmetrics like Pass@k (at least one success in k trials) and Max@k (maximum\nreward across k responses). This mismatch in risk preferences can inevitably\nlead to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Risk-Seeking\nPolicy Optimization (RSPO), a novel method that directly targets Pass@k and\nMax@k during training. A key challenge in optimizing these metrics is the\n\"hitchhiking\" problem: low-reward responses are inadvertently reinforced if\nthey co-occur with a high-reward response within a sample of k generations,\nresulting in inefficient optimization. RSPO addresses this problem by\nleveraging the closed-form probability that a given response is the maximum\namong k samplings. Despite the complexity of nested gradients over multiple\nresponses, RSPO produces efficient, unbiased gradient estimators for both\nmetrics. We validate our approach with both rigorous theoretical analysis and\ncomprehensive experimental results.",

      "abstract": "This work-in-progress paper presents SPARC (Systematic Problem Solving and\nAlgorithmic Reasoning for Children), a gamified learning platform designed to\nenhance engagement and knowledge retention in K-12 STEM education. Traditional\napproaches often struggle to motivate students or facilitate deep\nunderstanding, especially for complex scientific concepts. SPARC addresses\nthese challenges by integrating interactive, narrative-driven gameplay with an\nartificial intelligence peer agent built on large language models. Rather than\nsimply providing answers, the agent engages students in dialogue and inquiry,\nprompting them to explain concepts and solve problems collaboratively. The\nplatform's design is grounded in educational theory and closely aligned with\nstate learning standards. Initial classroom pilots utilized a multi-method\nassessment framework combining pre- and post-tests, in-game analytics, and\nqualitative feedback from students and teachers. Preliminary findings indicate\nthat SPARC significantly increases student engagement, with most participants\nreporting greater interest in STEM subjects and moderate gains in conceptual\nunderstanding observed in post-test results. Ongoing development focuses on\nrefining the AI agent, expanding curriculum integration, and improving\naccessibility. These early results demonstrate the potential of combining\nAI-driven peer support with game-based learning to create inclusive, effective,\nand engaging educational experiences for K-12 learners.",

      "abstract": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) aims to convert human speech content into\ncorresponding text. In conversational scenarios, effectively utilizing context\ncan enhance its accuracy. Large Language Models' (LLMs) exceptional\nlong-context understanding and reasoning abilities enable LLM-based ASR\n(LLM-ASR) to leverage historical context for recognizing conversational speech,\nwhich has a high degree of contextual relevance. However, existing\nconversational LLM-ASR methods use a fixed number of preceding utterances or\nthe entire conversation history as context, resulting in significant ASR\nconfusion and computational costs due to massive irrelevant and redundant\ninformation. This paper proposes a multi-modal retrieval-and-selection method\nnamed MARS that augments conversational LLM-ASR by enabling it to retrieve and\nselect the most relevant acoustic and textual historical context for the\ncurrent utterance. Specifically, multi-modal retrieval obtains a set of\ncandidate historical contexts, each exhibiting high acoustic or textual\nsimilarity to the current utterance. Multi-modal selection calculates the\nacoustic and textual similarities for each retrieved candidate historical\ncontext and, by employing our proposed near-ideal ranking method to consider\nboth similarities, selects the best historical context. Evaluations on the\nInterspeech 2025 Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Model Challenge\ndataset show that the LLM-ASR, when trained on only 1.5K hours of data and\nequipped with the MARS, outperforms the state-of-the-art top-ranking system\ntrained on 179K hours of data.",

However, these\nAI agents differ fundamentally from traditional deterministic software, posing\na significant challenge to conventional monitoring and debugging. This creates\na critical semantic gap: existing tools observe either an agent's high-level\nintent (via LLM prompts) or its low-level actions (e.g., system calls), but\ncannot correlate these two views. This blindness makes it difficult to\ndistinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures.\nWe introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this\nsemantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors\nagents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using\neBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic\nintent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally\ncorrelates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine\nand secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is\nframework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3%\nperformance overhead. Our evaluation shows AgentSight detects prompt injection\nattacks, identifies resource-wasting reasoning loops, and reveals hidden\ncoordination bottlenecks in multi-agent systems.

      "abstract": "The operation and maintenance (O&M) of database systems is critical to\nensuring system availability and performance, typically requiring expert\nexperience (e.g., identifying metric-to-anomaly relations) for effective\ndiagnosis and recovery. However, existing automatic database O&M methods,\nincluding commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On\nthe one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g.,\nmetric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and\ncannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting\nguidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve\nfragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate\ninaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present\nDBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with\nknowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a\nheterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and\nproposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from\nthousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+)\nreusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and\nimplicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps\nproposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis\npaths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a\nreasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear\ndiagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four\nmainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates\nthat DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher\nin root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Textual reviews enrich recommender systems with fine-grained preference\nsignals and enhanced explainability. However, in real-world scenarios, users\nrarely leave reviews, resulting in severe sparsity that undermines the\neffectiveness of existing models. A natural solution is to impute or generate\nmissing reviews to enrich the data. However, conventional imputation techniques\n-- such as matrix completion and LLM-based augmentation -- either lose\ncontextualized semantics by embedding texts into vectors, or overlook\nstructural dependencies among user-item interactions. To address these\nshortcomings, we propose TWISTER (ToWards Imputation on Sparsity with Textual\nEdge Graph Representation), a unified framework that imputes missing reviews by\njointly modeling semantic and structural signals. Specifically, we represent\nuser-item interactions as a Textual-Edge Graph (TEG), treating reviews as edge\nattributes. To capture relational context, we construct line-graph views and\nemploy a large language model as a graph-aware aggregator. For each interaction\nlacking a textual review, our model aggregates the neighborhood's\nnatural-language representations to generate a coherent and personalized\nreview. Experiments on the Amazon and Goodreads datasets show that TWISTER\nconsistently outperforms traditional numeric, graph-based, and LLM baselines,\ndelivering higher-quality imputed reviews and, more importantly, enhanced\nrecommendation performance. In summary, TWISTER generates reviews that are more\nhelpful, authentic, and specific, while smoothing structural signals for\nimproved recommendations.",

Using\nDemographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair\nLandsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on\nlocation/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We\ndevelop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International\nWealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images,\n(ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web\ntext, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework\nyields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms\nvision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on\nout-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than\nagent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time\ngeneralization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused\nembeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine\nsimilarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of\nmaterial well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the\nPlatonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms\nagent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest\ngains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that\nagent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not\nfully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale\nmultimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite\nimages, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.",

Despite their powerful capabilities, POPLs\npresent a steep learning curve and have not yet been adopted by the broader\nsoftware community. The lack of understanding about the proof-development\nprocess and how expert proof developers interact with POPLs has hindered the\nadvancement of effective proof engineering and the development of\nproof-synthesis models/tools.\n  In this work, we conduct a user study, involving the collection and analysis\nof fine-grained source code telemetry from eight experts working with two\nlanguages, F* and Verus. Results reveal interesting trends and patterns about\nhow experts reason about proofs and key challenges encountered during the proof\ndevelopment process. We identify three distinct strategies and multiple\ninformal practices that are not captured final code snapshots, yet are\npredictive of task outcomes. We translate these findings into concrete design\nguidance for AI proof assistants: bias toward early specification drafting,\nexplicit sub-goal decomposition, bounded active errors, and disciplined\nverifier interaction.

      "abstract": "Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large\nscale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for\nrapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive\ninformation, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world\nwhere data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification\n(DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting\nunauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its\ndiversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely\nchallenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied\non oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of\nsecurity. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model\nfirst learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet\nidentifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an\nout-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging\nVision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most\ninformative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer\nset, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a\nbetter trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments\nacross diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach\nsimultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly\noutperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and\neffectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we\nreveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for\nlong-term development to enhance practicality.",

Here, we introduce\nFGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with\nfunctional group information.

      "abstract": "We present ROVI, a high-quality synthetic dataset for instance-grounded\ntext-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M curated web images. Our key\ninnovation is a strategy called re-captioning, focusing on the pre-detection\nstage, where a VLM (Vision-Language Model) generates comprehensive visual\ndescriptions that are then processed by an LLM (Large Language Model) to\nextract a flat list of potential categories for OVDs (Open-Vocabulary\nDetectors) to detect. This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to\ninstance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically\noverlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in\nimage quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more\ncategories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a\ntext-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity,\nand aesthetic quality.

      "abstract": "With the growing use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based tools like ChatGPT,\nPerplexity, and Gemini across industries, there is a rising need for efficient\nLLM inference systems. These systems handle requests with a unique two-phase\ncomputation structure: a prefill-phase that processes the full input prompt and\na decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This\nstructure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests.\n  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by\ndeveloping a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM\ninference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and\ndynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput.\nGuided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD)\nscheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild\nconditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as\nserving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design\nthe SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements\nto prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and\nreorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the\nTime To First Token (TTFT) delays.\n  We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model\non an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU. Compared to Sarathi-Serve, SLAI reduces the\nmedian TTFT by 53% and increases the maximum serving capacity by 26% such that\nmedian TTFT is below 0.5 seconds, while meeting tail TBT latency constraints.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful\nalternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering\nefficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the\npractical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural\nconstraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static\nlength allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths\ncripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant\ncomputational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While\nthe inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses\ninternal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given\ntask. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce\nDAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive\nLength Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two\nphases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial\nlength and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided\nby a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL\ndynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation\nregions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully\ndeveloped. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves\nperformance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned\nfixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency\nby achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length\nconstraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap\nwith their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient\nand capable generation.",

However,\ntraditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question\nanswering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability\nto handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG\nframework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions,\niteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and\ndynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning\ndiverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms\n(general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104\nexpert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and\nExtendedQA datasets.

Even\nclinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g.,\nMedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of\nretrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic\nframeworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA,\nparticularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their\nclinical utility.",

This paper presents a comprehensive review of\nrecent research at the intersection of LLMs and VR, examining how these models\nare transforming narrative generation, non-player character (NPC) interactions,\naccessibility, personalization, and game mastering. Drawing from an analysis of\n62 peer reviewed studies published between 2018 and 2025, we identify key\napplication domains ranging from emotionally intelligent NPCs and procedurally\ngenerated storytelling to AI-driven adaptive systems and inclusive gameplay\ninterfaces. We also address the major challenges facing this convergence,\nincluding real-time performance constraints, memory limitations, ethical risks,\nand scalability barriers. Our findings highlight that while LLMs significantly\nenhance realism, creativity, and user engagement in VR environments, their\neffective deployment requires robust design strategies that integrate\nmultimodal interaction, hybrid AI architectures, and ethical safeguards. The\npaper concludes by outlining future research directions in multimodal AI,\naffective computing, reinforcement learning, and open-source development,\naiming to guide the responsible advancement of intelligent and inclusive VR\nsystems.",

      "abstract": "Despite growing interest in hallucination in Multimodal Large Language\nModels, existing studies primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving\nhallucination in multi-image scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap,\nwe conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs\nand propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating\nobject-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three\ncore tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object\nCount Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting\nsemantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and\ncross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key\nfactors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations,\nincluding: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and\nthe likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between\nsingle-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image\ncontexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional\nplacement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of\nobject identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we\npropose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image\nattention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention\nproportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that\nour method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic\nintegration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language\nqueries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging\ntheir relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent\nKGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on\nGNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation\nstrategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly\nperform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited\nadaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement,\nwhile the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate\npath evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM\ncalls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive\nMCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search\nwith adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR\nemploys a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based\nplanner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search\nspace. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight\nTransformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by\njointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention,\nenabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop\nreasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision,\nDAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically\ngenerates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing\nthe scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning\ntrajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

Despite the widespread use of\nthis technology, it remains unclear how well LLMs generate code solutions in\nterms of software quality and how they compare to human-written code. Aims:\nThis study compares the internal quality attributes of LLM-generated and\nhuman-written code. Method: Our empirical study integrates datasets of coding\ntasks, three LLM configurations (zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning), and\nSonarQube to assess software quality. The dataset comprises Python code\nsolutions across three difficulty levels: introductory, interview, and\ncompetition. We analyzed key code quality metrics, including maintainability\nand reliability, and the estimated effort required to resolve code issues.\nResults: Our analysis shows that LLM-generated code has fewer bugs and requires\nless effort to fix them overall. Interestingly, fine-tuned models reduced the\nprevalence of high-severity issues, such as blocker and critical bugs, and\nshifted them to lower-severity categories, but decreased the model's\nperformance. In competition-level problems, the LLM solutions sometimes\nintroduce structural issues that are not present in human-written code.\nConclusion: Our findings provide valuable insights into the quality of\nLLM-generated code; however, the introduction of critical issues in more\ncomplex scenarios highlights the need for a systematic evaluation and\nvalidation of LLM solutions. Our work deepens the understanding of the\nstrengths and limitations of LLMs for code generation.",

To tackle these issues, we built a new metric and a\nmulti-agent system.\n  We propose AVR-Eval, a relative metric for multimedia content quality using\nAudio-Visual Recordings (AVRs).

With the\ngrowing use of Large Language Models (LLM) as AI modeling assistants, more\nautomation will be involved in generating diagrams. This necessitates the\nadvancement of automatic model correctness evaluation tools. Such a tool can be\nused to evaluate both manually and AI automatically generated models; to\nprovide feedback to system engineers, and enable AI assistants to self-evaluate\nand self-enhance their generated models.\n  In this paper, we propose MCeT, the first fully automated tool to evaluate\nthe correctness of a behavioral model, sequence diagrams in particular, against\nits corresponding requirements text and produce a list of issues that the model\nhas. We utilize LLMs for the correctness evaluation tasks as they have shown\noutstanding natural language understanding ability.

We propose to supplement the\ndirect check with a fine-grained, multi-perspective approach; we split the\ndiagram into atomic, non-divisible interactions, and split the requirements\ntext into atomic, self-contained items. We compare the diagram with atomic\nrequirements and each diagram-atom with the requirements. We also propose a\nself-consistency checking approach that combines perspectives to mitigate LLM\nhallucinated issues. Our combined approach improves upon the precision of the\ndirect approach from 0.58 to 0.81 in a dataset of real requirements.

We rigorously examine the machine-learning procedure to build these\ndetectors to address this. Most current AIG text detection datasets focus on\nzero-shot generations, but little work has been done on few-shot or one-shot\ngenerations, where LLMs are given human texts as an example. In response, we\nintroduce the Diverse Adversarial Corpus of Texts Yielded from Language models\n(DACTYL), a challenging AIG text detection dataset focusing on\none-shot/few-shot generations. We also include texts from domain-specific\ncontinued-pre-trained (CPT) language models, where we fully train all\nparameters using a memory-efficient optimization approach. Many existing AIG\ntext detectors struggle significantly on our dataset, indicating a potential\nvulnerability to one-shot/few-shot and CPT-generated texts. We also train our\nown classifiers using two approaches: standard binary cross-entropy (BCE)\noptimization and a more recent approach, deep X-risk optimization (DXO). While\nBCE-trained classifiers marginally outperform DXO classifiers on the DACTYL\ntest set, the latter excels on out-of-distribution (OOD) texts. In our mock\ndeployment scenario in student essay detection with an OOD student essay\ndataset, the best DXO classifier outscored the best BCE-trained classifier by\n50.56 macro-F1 score points at the lowest false positive rates for both. Our\nresults indicate that DXO classifiers generalize better without overfitting to\nthe test set. Our experiments highlight several areas of improvement for AIG\ntext detectors.",

Sharpness-Aware\nMinimization (SAM) improves model generalization for both Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) and Transformers by encouraging convergence to locally flat\nminima. However, the connection between sharpness and generalization has not\nbeen fully explored for LoRA due to the lack of tools to either empirically\nseek flat minima or develop theoretical methods. In this work, we propose\nFlat-LoRA and its efficient version i.e., EFlat-LoRA, to seek flat minima for\nLoRA. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that perturbations in the full\nparameter space can be transferred to the low-rank subspace. This approach\neliminates the potential interference introduced by perturbations across\nmultiple matrices in the low-rank subspace. Our extensive experiments on large\nlanguage models and vision-language models demonstrate that EFlat-LoRA achieves\noptimize efficiency comparable to that of LoRA while simultaneously attaining\ncomparable or even better performance. For example, on the GLUE dataset with\nRoBERTa-large, EFlat-LoRA outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning by 1.0% and\n0.5% on average, respectively. On vision-language models e.g., Qwen-VL-Chat\nshows performance improvements of 1.5% and 1.0% on SQA and VizWiz datasets,\nrespectively.

      "title": "Court of LLMs: Evidence-Augmented Generation via Multi-LLM Collaboration for Text-Attributed Graph Anomaly Detection",
      "abstract": "The natural combination of intricate topological structures and rich textual\ninformation in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) opens up a novel perspective for\ngraph anomaly detection (GAD). However, existing GAD methods primarily focus on\ndesigning complex optimization objectives within the graph domain, overlooking\nthe complementary value of the textual modality, whose features are often\nencoded by shallow embedding techniques, such as bag-of-words or skip-gram, so\nthat semantic context related to anomalies may be missed. To unleash the\nenormous potential of textual modality, large language models (LLMs) have\nemerged as promising alternatives due to their strong semantic understanding\nand reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, their application to TAG anomaly\ndetection remains nascent, and they struggle to encode high-order structural\ninformation inherent in graphs due to input length constraints. For\nhigh-quality anomaly detection in TAGs, we propose CoLL, a novel framework that\ncombines LLMs and graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage their complementary\nstrengths. CoLL employs multi-LLM collaboration for evidence-augmented\ngeneration to capture anomaly-relevant contexts while delivering human-readable\nrationales for detected anomalies. Moreover, CoLL integrates a GNN equipped\nwith a gating mechanism to adaptively fuse textual features with evidence while\npreserving high-order topological information. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority of CoLL, achieving an average improvement of 13.37%\nin AP. This study opens a new avenue for incorporating LLMs in advancing GAD.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit powerful autonomous capabilities\nacross domains such as robotics, virtual assistants, and web automation.\nHowever, their stochastic behavior introduces significant safety risks that are\ndifficult to anticipate. Existing rule-based enforcement systems, such as\nAgentSpec, focus on developing reactive safety rules, which typically respond\nonly when unsafe behavior is imminent or has already occurred. These systems\nlack foresight and struggle with long-horizon dependencies and distribution\nshifts. To address these limitations, we propose Pro2Guard, a proactive runtime\nenforcement framework grounded in probabilistic reachability analysis.\nPro2Guard abstracts agent behaviors into symbolic states and learns a\nDiscrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from execution traces.

By incorporating semantic validity\nchecks and leveraging PAC bounds, Pro2Guard ensures statistical reliability\nwhile approximating the underlying ground-truth model. We evaluate Pro2Guard\nextensively across two safety-critical domains: embodied household agents and\nautonomous vehicles. In embodied agent tasks, Pro2Guard enforces safety early\non up to 93.6% of unsafe tasks using low thresholds, while configurable modes\n(e.g., reflect) allow balancing safety with task success, maintaining up to\n80.4% task completion.

To effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in this domain, it\nis crucial to have a well-designed benchmark that accurately reflects\nreal-world scenarios and mitigates common pitfalls. Existing LLM test\ngeneration benchmarks are limited by two critical drawbacks: data contamination\nand structurally simple function code. As a result, we often cannot rely on the\nvalidity of scientific conclusions drawn from empirical studies using these\nlimited benchmarks. The empirical evidence presented may be biased due to\ncontamination and may fail to generalize beyond toy programs due to structural\nsimplicity.\n  To address these problems, we introduce ULT (UnLeakedTestbench), a new\nbenchmark specifically designed for function-level unit test generation from\nreal-world Python functions. ULT is constructed through a multi-stage curation\nprocess that ensures high cyclomatic complexity and mitigates test case\ncontamination. With 3,909 carefully selected function-level tasks, ULT provides\na more realistic and challenging evaluation of LLMs' test generation\ncapabilities. We also provide PLT (PreLeakedTestbench), a pair benchmark of ULT\nwith leaked tests designed to enable a controlled analysis of memorization\nversus reasoning in test generation. Our evaluation results demonstrate that\nULT is significantly more challenging. For example, test cases generated by\nLLMs only achieve 41.32\\%, 45.10\\%, 30.22\\%, and 40.21\\% for accuracy,\nstatement coverage, branch coverage, and mutation score on average for all\nLLMs, respectively.

To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS\ndataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a\nmixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nCued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios\ncompared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at\nhttps://github.com/DennisHgj/Cued-Agent.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution\nfor universal embedding tasks, yet adapting their generative nature for\ndiscriminative representation learning remains a significant challenge. The\ndominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical\ninefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to\nleverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To\novercome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal\nmultimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic\ncomponents. First, our hierarchical embedding prompt template employs a\ntwo-level instruction architecture that forces the model to produce\ndiscriminative representations. Building on this strong foundation, our second\ncomponent, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process\nby leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging\nnegatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives. Our\ncomprehensive experiments show that our hierarchical prompt achieves zero-shot\nperformance competitive with contrastively trained baselines and enhances the\nfine-tuning process by lifting a simple in-batch negative baseline by 4.8\npoints on the MMEB benchmark. We further boost the performance via our\nself-aware hard negative sampling, achieving the state-of-the-art performance\nwithout the contrative pre-training. Our work presents an effective and\nefficient pathway to adapt MLLMs for universal embedding tasks, significantly\nreducing training time.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms of in-context\nlearning (ICL) effectiveness to inspire the design of related methods. However,\nexisting work predominantly assumes the effectiveness of the demonstrations\nprovided within ICL, while many research indicates that not all demonstrations\nare effective, failing to yielding any performance improvement during ICL.\nTherefore, in this paper, we investigate the reasons behind demonstration\nineffectiveness. Our analysis is based on gradient flow and linear\nself-attention models. By setting the gradient flow to zero, we deduce that a\ndemonstration becomes ineffective if its information has either been learned by\nthe model or is irrelevant to the user query. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nin multi-layer models, the disparity in effectiveness among demonstrations is\namplified with layer increasing, causing the model to focus more on effective\nones. Considering that current demonstration selection methods primarily focus\non the relevance to the user query while overlooking the information that the\nmodel has already assimilated, we propose a novel method called GradS, which\nleverages gradient flow for demonstration selection. We use the magnitude of\nthe gradient flow of the demonstration with respect to a given user query as\nthe criterion, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the chosen ones. We\nvalidate our derivation and GradS on four prominent LLMs across five mainstream\ndatasets. The experimental results confirm that the disparity in effectiveness\namong demonstrations is magnified as the model layer increases, substantiating\nour derivations. Moreover, GradS achieves a relative improvement of $6.8\\%$ on\naverage over the strongest baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.",

Despite their potential, existing work faces challenges\nwhen deploying LLMs in agent-based environments. The widely adopted agent\nparadigm ReAct centers on integrating single-step reasoning with immediate\naction execution, which limits its effectiveness in complex tasks requiring\nlong-term strategic planning. Furthermore, the coordination between the planner\nand executor during problem-solving is also a critical factor to consider in\nagent design. Additionally, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised\nfine-tuning, which often leads models to memorize established task completion\ntrajectories, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted\nwith novel problem contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce an\nadaptive global plan-based agent paradigm AdaPlan, aiming to synergize\nhigh-level explicit guidance with execution to support effective long-horizon\ndecision-making.

      "title": "Mind the Gap: The Divergence Between Human and LLM-Generated Tasks",
      "abstract": "Humans constantly generate a diverse range of tasks guided by internal\nmotivations. While generative agents powered by large language models (LLMs)\naim to simulate this complex behavior, it remains uncertain whether they\noperate on similar cognitive principles. To address this, we conducted a\ntask-generation experiment comparing human responses with those of an LLM agent\n(GPT-4o). We find that human task generation is consistently influenced by\npsychological drivers, including personal values (e.g., Openness to Change) and\ncognitive style. Even when these psychological drivers are explicitly provided\nto the LLM, it fails to reflect the corresponding behavioral patterns. They\nproduce tasks that are markedly less social, less physical, and thematically\nbiased toward abstraction. Interestingly, while the LLM's tasks were perceived\nas more fun and novel, this highlights a disconnect between its linguistic\nproficiency and its capacity to generate human-like, embodied goals. We\nconclude that there is a core gap between the value-driven, embodied nature of\nhuman cognition and the statistical patterns of LLMs, highlighting the\nnecessity of incorporating intrinsic motivation and physical grounding into the\ndesign of more human-aligned agents.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have opened up greater\nopportunities to enable fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to behave as\nmore powerful interactive agents through improved instruction-following\nability. However, understanding how this impacts confidence calibration for\nreliable model output has not been researched in full. In this work, we examine\nvarious open-sourced LLMs, identifying significant calibration degradation\nafter instruction tuning in each. Seeking a practical solution, we look towards\nlabel smoothing, which has been shown as an effective method to regularize for\noverconfident predictions but has yet to be widely adopted in the supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs. We first provide insight as to why label smoothing\nis sufficient to maintain calibration throughout the SFT process. However,\nsettings remain where the effectiveness of smoothing is severely diminished, in\nparticular the case of large vocabulary LLMs (LV-LLMs). We posit the cause to\nstem from the ability to become over-confident, which has a direct relationship\nwith the hidden size and vocabulary size, and justify this theoretically and\nexperimentally. Finally, we address an outstanding issue regarding the memory\nfootprint of the cross-entropy loss computation in the label smoothed loss\nsetting, designing a customized kernel to dramatically reduce memory\nconsumption without sacrificing speed or performance in comparison to existing\nsolutions for non-smoothed losses.",

Recent methods update a visual projector to translate visual\ninformation for new tasks, connecting pre-trained vision encoders with large\nlanguage models.

To avoid using experts for irrelevant instruction contexts, we propose\nan expert recommendation strategy that reuses experts for tasks similar to\nthose previously learned. Additionally, we introduce expert pruning to\nalleviate interference from the use of experts that cumulatively activated in\nprevious tasks.

      "abstract": "Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have the potential to revolutionize\ncommunications by supporting a range of applications, including urban parcel\ndelivery, aerial inspections and air taxis. However, compared with traditional\nwireless networks, LAWNs face unique security challenges due to low-altitude\noperations, frequent mobility and reliance on unlicensed spectrum, making it\nmore vulnerable to some malicious attacks. In this paper, we investigate some\nlarge artificial intelligence model (LAM)-enabled solutions for secure\ncommunications in LAWNs. Specifically, we first explore the amplified security\nrisks and important limitations of traditional AI methods in LAWNs. Then, we\nintroduce the basic concepts of LAMs and delve into the role of LAMs in\naddressing these challenges. To demonstrate the practical benefits of LAMs for\nsecure communications in LAWNs, we propose a novel LAM-based optimization\nframework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate enhanced\nstate features on top of handcrafted representations, and to design intrinsic\nrewards accordingly, thereby improving reinforcement learning performance for\nsecure communication tasks.

      "abstract": "Graph model generation from natural language description is an important task\nwith many applications in software engineering. With the rise of large language\nmodels (LLMs), there is a growing interest in using LLMs for graph model\ngeneration. Nevertheless, LLM-based graph model generation typically produces\npartially correct models that suffer from three main issues: (1) syntax\nviolations: the generated model may not adhere to the syntax defined by its\nmetamodel, (2) constraint inconsistencies: the structure of the model might not\nconform to some domain-specific constraints, and (3) inaccuracy: due to the\ninherent uncertainty in LLMs, the models can include inaccurate, hallucinated\nelements. While the first issue is often addressed through techniques such as\nconstraint decoding or filtering, the latter two remain largely unaddressed.\nMotivated by recent self-consistency approaches in LLMs, we propose a novel\nabstraction-concretization framework that enhances the consistency and quality\nof generated graph models by considering multiple outputs from an LLM. Our\napproach first constructs a probabilistic partial model that aggregates all\ncandidate outputs and then refines this partial model into the most appropriate\nconcrete model that satisfies all constraints. We evaluate our framework on\nseveral popular open-source and closed-source LLMs using diverse datasets for\nmodel generation tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly\nimproves both the consistency and quality of the generated graph models.",

      "title": "Model Misalignment and Language Change: Traces of AI-Associated Language in Unscripted Spoken English",
      "abstract": "In recent years, written language, particularly in science and education, has\nundergone remarkable shifts in word usage. These changes are widely attributed\nto the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely\non a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target\naudience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are\noften linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to\ngenerate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes\nin the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a\ndataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from\nconversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends\nbefore and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated\nwords. Our results show a moderate yet significant increase in the usage of\nthese words post-2022, suggesting a convergence between human word choices and\nLLM-associated patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no\nsignificant directional shift. Given the short time frame and the number of\nwords affected, this may indicate the onset of a remarkable shift in language\nuse. Whether this represents natural language change or a novel shift driven by\nAI exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the shifts may stem\nfrom broader adoption patterns, it may also be that upstream training\nmisalignments ultimately contribute to changes in human language use. These\nfindings parallel ethical concerns that misaligned models may shape social and\nmoral beliefs.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,\nleading to a significant increase in user demand for LLM services. However,\ncloud-based LLM services often suffer from high latency, unstable\nresponsiveness, and privacy concerns. Therefore, multiple LLMs are usually\ndeployed at the network edge to boost real-time responsiveness and protect data\nprivacy, particularly for many emerging smart mobile and IoT applications.\nGiven the varying response quality and latency of LLM services, a critical\nissue is how to route user requests from mobile and IoT devices to an\nappropriate LLM service (i.e., edge LLM expert) to ensure acceptable\nquality-of-service (QoS). Existing routing algorithms fail to simultaneously\naddress the heterogeneity of LLM services, the interference among requests, and\nthe dynamic workloads necessary for maintaining long-term stable QoS. To meet\nthese challenges, in this paper we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL)-based QoS-aware LLM routing framework for sustained high-quality LLM\nservices. Due to the dynamic nature of the global state, we propose a dynamic\nstate abstraction technique to compactly represent global state features with a\nheterogeneous graph attention network (HAN). Additionally, we introduce an\naction impact estimator and a tailored reward function to guide the DRL agent\nin maximizing QoS and preventing latency violations.
