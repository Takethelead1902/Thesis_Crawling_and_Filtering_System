      "title": "A Multi-Stage Large Language Model Framework for Extracting Suicide-Related Social Determinants of Health",
      "abstract": "Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors\ncontributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and\nprevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such\nas long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding\nsuicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a\nmulti-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction\nfrom unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art\nlanguage models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning\nmodels (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help\npeople annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included\nboth automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our\nproposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of\nextracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant\ncontext. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model\nachieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The\nmulti-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate\nexplanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach\nimproves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH\nfrom unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early\nidentification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention\nstrategies.",

      "abstract": "Open-Vocabulary Multimodal Emotion Recognition (OV-MER) aims to predict\nemotions without being constrained by predefined label spaces, enabling\nfine-grained and human-like emotion understanding. Unlike traditional\ndiscriminative methods, OV-MER leverages generative models, such as large\nlanguage models (LLMs) with extensive vocabularies, to capture the full\nspectrum of emotions. Previous approaches (like AffectGPT) primarily rely on\ntoken-level loss for training. However, this objective does not align with the\nemotion wheel (EW)-based evaluation metrics used in OV-MER. Unfortunately,\nEW-based metrics cannot be directly optimized via gradient backpropagation. In\nthis paper, we propose AffectGPT-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that\ndirectly optimizes performance on EW-based metrics. Specifically, we treat\nthese metrics as the reward function and employ Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) to maximize rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that\nAffectGPT-R1 achieves significant improvements on OV-MER. We hope this work\nadvances the field of multimodal emotion recognition.

      "abstract": "This study evaluates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate\nstructured clinical consultation templates for electronic consultation. Using\n145 expert-crafted templates developed and routinely used by Stanford's\neConsult team, we assess frontier models -- including o3, GPT-4o, Kimi K2,\nClaude 4 Sonnet, Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 2.5 Pro -- for their ability to\nproduce clinically coherent, concise, and prioritized clinical question\nschemas. Through a multi-agent pipeline combining prompt optimization, semantic\nautograding, and prioritization analysis, we show that while models like o3\nachieve high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2\\%), they consistently generate\nexcessively long templates and fail to correctly prioritize the most clinically\nimportant questions under length constraints. Performance varies across\nspecialties, with significant degradation in narrative-driven fields such as\npsychiatry and pain medicine. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can enhance\nstructured clinical information exchange between physicians, while highlighting\nthe need for more robust evaluation methods that capture a model's ability to\nprioritize clinically salient information within the time constraints of\nreal-world physician communication.",

      "title": "Benchmarking and Bridging Emotion Conflicts for Multimodal Emotion Reasoning",
      "abstract": "Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving\nemotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are\ninconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark\ndesigned to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of\nthree subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or\nall modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER\nreveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on\naudio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual\nmodality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient\nframework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two\nmodules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism\nthat reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention\nreallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen\nbackbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it\nmitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent\nsamples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities.\nExperiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our\nCA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nparticularly under modality conflict conditions.",

Current research shows that using large language\nmodels (LLMs) to fine-tune a task-specific preference extractor yields\nexcellent results in terms of accuracy and generalization. However, the primary\nchallenge stems from the inherent difficulty in obtaining high-quality labeled\nmulti-turn dialogue data. Accurately tracking user preference transitions\nacross turns not only demands intensive domain expertise and contextual\nconsistency maintenance for annotators (termed \\textbf{``Annotating\nDisaster''}) but also complicates model training due to error propagation in\nsequential dependency learning. Inspired by the observation that multi-turn\npreference extraction can be decomposed into iterative executions of one-turn\nextraction processes. We propose a novel dialogue data generation framework\nnamed \\textbf{IterChat}. First, we construct a new data format that categorizes\nthe dialogue data into attributed historical preferences and one-turn\ndialogues. This reduces the probability of annotation errors and improves\nannotation efficiency. Then, to generate a high-quality and diverse dialogue\ndataset, we adopt GPT4 to pre-define the preference slots in the target\npreference extractor task and then randomly sample the subset of the slots and\ntheir corresponding schema values to create the dialogue datasets. Experimental\nresults indicate that fine-tuning or only few-shot prompting with the new\ndialogue format yields superior performance compared to the original multi-turn\ndialogues. Additionally, the new data format improves annotator efficiency with\na win rate of 28.4\\% higher than the original multi-turn dialogues.",

      "abstract": "Online medical consultation platforms, while convenient, are undermined by\nsignificant privacy risks that erode user trust. We first conducted in-depth\nsemi-structured interviews with 12 users to understand their perceptions of\nsecurity and privacy landscapes on online medical consultation platforms, as\nwell as their practices, challenges and expectation. Our analysis reveals a\ncritical disconnect between users' desires for anonymity and control, and\nplatform realities that offload the responsibility of ``privacy labor''. To\nbridge this gap, we present SafeShare, an interaction technique that leverages\nlocalized LLM to redact consultations in real-time. SafeShare balances utility\nand privacy through selectively anonymize private information. A technical\nevaluation of SafeShare's core PII detection module on 3 dataset demonstrates\nhigh efficacy, achieving 89.64\\% accuracy with Qwen3-4B on IMCS21 dataset.",

Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing\nmodel representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model\nuser sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to\nstudy persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage\ninsights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of\npersuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.\nDespite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of\npersuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can\nidentify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where\npersuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show\nthat in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,\nprobes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such\nas when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible\navenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and\nmanipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset\nanalysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.",

      "abstract": "Evaluating the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs)\nremains a challenging task. Current mainstream approaches primarily rely on the\n``LLM-as-a-judge\" paradigm, where an LLM is prompted to serve as an evaluator\nto assess dialogue quality. However, such methods often suffer from various\nbiases, which undermine the reliability and consistency of the evaluation\nresults. To mitigate these biases, recent methods employ multiple LLMs as\njudges and aggregate their judgments to select the optimal assessment. Although\neffective, this multi-judge approach incurs significant computational overhead\nduring inference. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-turn dialogue\nevaluator that captures the collective wisdom of multiple LLM judges by\naggregating their preference knowledge into a single model. Our approach\npreserves the advantages of diverse multi-judge feedback while drastically\nreducing the evaluation cost, enabling fast and flexible dialogue quality\nassessment. Extensive experiments on seven single rating and pairwise\ncomparison dialogue evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that our method\noutperforms existing baselines across diverse scenarios, showcasing its\nefficiency and robustness.",

Despite recent advances in\nusing large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most\napproaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic\nscoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this\npaper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy\noptimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent\ncomponents under a unified objective. To address this, we propose\nMulti-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a\nnovel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based\noptimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one\ncomponent by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior\nupdates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This\nstructured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the\ndiscovery of diverse, high-performing solutions.

A rigorous filtering step is\nemployed to maintain high dialogue quality. We validate ProKG Dial on a medical\nknowledge graph by evaluating the generated dialogues in terms of diversity,\nsemantic coherence, and entity coverage.
